Many years ago dinosaurs were the largest creatures on earth. 
Some were very large and others small. 
They also came in many different colors. 
Behind the fiery mountains was a valley in which the dinosaurs spent the day. 
One sunny day the dinosaurs were playing a game of soccer. 
A new dinosaur that the other dinosaurs had not seen before came walking by. 
He stopped and watched and then he asked, " Could I play too?" All of the other dinosaurs looked at him. 
Together in one giant voice they said " NO!" The reason they had said no to him was because he looked different than the others. 
He had a long neck and he was green. 
None of them had ever heard of or seen a long necked, green dinosaur. 
The new dinosaur was very sad because everyone said no to him and they even called him 'Greeny'. 
His feelings were hurt. 
Slowly he sat down and sadly watched the others play..
