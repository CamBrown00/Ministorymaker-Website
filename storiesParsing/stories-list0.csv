1,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"With almost everything else to make them happy , they wanted one thing : they had no children ."
2,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"This vexed the king even more than the queen , who was very clever and learned , and who had hated dolls when she was a child ."
3,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"However , she , too in spite of all the books she read and all the pictures she painted , would have been glad enough to be the mother of a little prince ."
4,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The king was anxious to consult the fairies , but the queen would not hear of such a thing ."
5,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"She did not believe in fairies : she said that they had never existed ; and that she maintained , though The History of the Royal Family was full of chapters about nothing else ."
6,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Well , at long and at last they had a little boy , who was generally regarded as the finest baby that had ever been seen ."
7,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Even her majesty herself remarked that , though she could never believe all the courtiers told her , yet he certainly was a fine child -- a very fine child ."
8,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Now , the time drew near for the christening party , and the king and queen were sitting at breakfast in their summer parlour talking over it ."
9,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"It was a splendid room , hung with portraits of the royal ancestors ."
10,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"There was Cinderella , the grandmother of the reigning monarch , with her little foot in her glass slipper thrust out before her ."
11,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"There was the Marquis de Carabas , who , as everyone knows , was raised to the throne as prince consort after his marriage with the daughter of the king of the period ."
12,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"On the arm of the throne was seated his celebrated cat , wearing boots ."
13,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"There , too , was a portrait of a beautiful lady , sound asleep : this was Madame La Belle au Bois-dormant , also an ancestress of the royal family ."
14,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Many other pictures of celebrated persons were hanging on the walls .
15,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` You have asked all the right people , my dear ? '' said the king ."
16,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Everyone who should be asked , '' answered the queen ."
17,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` People are so touchy on these occasions , '' said his majesty ."
18,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` You have not forgotten any of our aunts ? ''
19,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` No ; the old cats ! '' replied the queen ; for the king 's aunts were old-fashioned , and did not approve of her , and she knew it ."
20,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` They are very kind old ladies in their way , '' said the king ; `` and were nice to me when I was a boy . ''"
21,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he waited a little , and remarked : `` The fairies , of course , you have invited ?"
22,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"It has always been usual , in our family , on an occasion like this ; and I think we have neglected them a little of late . ''"
23,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` How can you be so absurd ? '' cried the queen .
24,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` How often must I tell you that there are no fairies ?
25,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And even if there were -- but , no matter ; pray let us drop the subject . ''"
26,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` They are very old friends of our family , my dear , that 's all , '' said the king timidly ."
27,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Often and often they have been godmothers to us .
28,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"One , in particular , was most kind and most serviceable to Cinderella I. , my own grandmother . ''"
29,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Your grandmother ! '' interrupted her majesty .
30,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Fiddle-de-dee ! If anyone puts such nonsense into the head of my little Prigio -- '' 
31,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But here the baby was brought in by the nurse , and the queen almost devoured it with kisses ."
32,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,And so the fairies were not invited !
33,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"It was an extraordinary thing , but none of the nobles could come to the christening party when they learned that the fairies had not been asked ."
34,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Some were abroad ; several were ill ; a few were in prison among the Saracens ; others were captives in the dens of ogres .
35,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The end of it was that the king and queen had to sit down alone , one at each end of a very long table , arrayed with plates and glasses for a hundred guests -- for a hundred guests who never came !"
36,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Any soup , my dear ? '' shouted the king , through a speaking-trumpet ; when , suddenly , the air was filled with a sound like the rustling of the wings of birds ."
37,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Flitter , flitter , flutter , went the noise ; and when the queen looked up , lo and behold ! on every seat was a lovely fairy , dressed in green , each with a most interesting-looking parcel in her hand ."
38,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Do n't you like opening parcels ?
39,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The king did , and he was most friendly and polite to the fairies ."
40,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the queen , though she saw them distinctly , took no notice of them ."
41,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"You see , she did not believe in fairies , nor in her own eyes , when she saw them ."
42,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"So she talked across the fairies to the king , just as if they had not been there ; but the king behaved as politely as if they were real -- which , of course , they were ."
43,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"When dinner was over , and when the nurse had brought in the baby , all the fairies gave him the most magnificent presents ."
44,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"One offered a purse which could never be empty ; and one a pair of seven-leagued boots ; and another a cap of darkness , that nobody might see the prince when he put it on ; and another a wishing-cap ; and another a carpet , on which , when he sat , he was carried wherever he wished to find himself ."
45,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Another made him beautiful for ever ; and another , brave ; and another , lucky : but the last fairy of all , a cross old thing , crept up and said , `` My child , you shall be too clever ! ''"
46,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"This fairy 's gift would have pleased the queen , if she had believed in it , more than anything else , because she was so clever herself ."
47,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But she took no notice at all ; and the fairies went each to her own country , and none of them stayed there at the palace , where nobody believed in them , except the king , a little ."
48,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the queen tossed all their nice boots and caps , carpets , purses , swords , and all , away into a dark lumber-room ; for , of course , she thought that they were all nonsense , and merely old rubbish out of books , or pantomime `` properties . ''"
49,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Well , the little prince grew up ."
50,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,I think I 've told you that his name was Prigio -- did I not ?
51,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Well , that was his name ."
52,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,You can not think how clever he was .
53,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He argued with his nurse as soon as he could speak , which was very soon ."
54,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He argued that he did not like to be washed , because the soap got into his eyes ."
55,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"However , when he was told all about the pores of the skin , and how they could not be healthy if he was not washed , he at once ceased to resist , for he was very reasonable ."
56,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He argued with his father that he did not see why there should be kings who were rich , while beggars were poor ; and why the king -- who was a little greedy -- should have poached eggs and plum-cake at afternoon tea , while many other persons went without dinner ."
57,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The king was so surprised and hurt at these remarks that he boxed the prince 's ears , saying , `` I 'll teach you to be too clever , my lad . ''"
58,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he remembered the awful curse of the oldest fairy , and was sorry for the rudeness of the queen ."
59,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And when the prince , after having his ears boxed , said that `` force was no argument , '' the king went away in a rage ."
60,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Indeed , I can not tell you how the prince was hated by all !"
61,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He would go down into the kitchen , and show the cook how to make soup ."
62,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He would visit the poor people 's cottage , and teach them how to make the beds , and how to make plum-pudding out of turnip-tops , and venison cutlets out of rusty bacon ."
63,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He showed the fencing-master how to fence , and the professional cricketer how to bowl , and instructed the rat-catcher in breeding terriers ."
64,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He set sums to the Chancellor of the Exchequer , and assured the Astronomer Royal that the sun does not go round the earth -- which , for my part , I believe it does ."
65,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The young ladies of the Court disliked dancing with him , in spite of his good looks , because he was always asking , `` Have you read this ? '' and `` Have you read that ? '' -- and when they said they had n't , he sneered ; and when they said they had , he found them out ."
66,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He found out all his tutors and masters in the same horrid way ; correcting the accent of his French teacher , and trying to get his German tutor not to eat peas with his knife ."
67,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He also endeavoured to teach the queen-dowager , his grandmother , an art with which she had long been perfectly familiar !"
68,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"In fact , he knew everything better than anybody else ; and the worst of it was that he did : and he was never in the wrong , and he always said , `` Did n't I tell you so ? ''"
69,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And , what was more , he had !"
70,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"As time went on , Prince Prigio had two younger brothers , whom everybody liked ."
71,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"They were not a bit clever , but jolly ."
72,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Prince Alphonso , the third son , was round , fat , good-humoured , and as brave as a lion ."
73,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Prince Enrico , the second , was tall , thin , and a little sad , but never too clever ."
74,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Both were in love with two of their own cousins with the approval of their dear parents ; and all the world said , `` What nice , unaffected princes they are ! ''"
75,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,But Prigio nearly got the country into several wars by being too clever for the foreign ambassadors .
76,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Now , as Pantouflia was a rich , lazy country , which hated fighting , this was very unpleasant , and did not make people love Prince Prigio any better ."
77,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Of all the people who did not like Prigio , his own dear papa , King Grognio , disliked him most ."
78,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"For the king knew he was not clever , himself ."
79,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"When he was in the counting-house , counting out his money , and when he happened to say , `` Sixteen shillings and fourteen and twopence are three pounds , fifteen , '' it made him wild to hear Prigio whisper , `` One pound , ten and twopence '' -- which , of course , it is ."
80,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And the king was afraid that Prigio would conspire , and get made king himself -- which was the last thing Prigio really wanted ."
81,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He much preferred to idle about , and know everything without seeming to take any trouble ."
82,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Well , the king thought and thought ."
83,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"How was he to get Prigio out of the way , and make Enrico or Alphonso his successor ?"
84,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He read in books about it ; and all the books showed that , if a king sent his three sons to do anything , it was always the youngest who did it , and got the crown ."
85,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,And he wished he had the chance .
86,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Well , it arrived at last ."
87,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,There was a very hot summer !
88,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,It began to be hot in March .
89,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,All the rivers were dried up .
90,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,The grass did not grow .
91,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,The corn did not grow .
92,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,The thermometers exploded with heat .
93,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,The barometers stood at SET FAIR .
94,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The people were much distressed , and came and broke the palace windows -- as they usually do when things go wrong in Pantouflia ."
95,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The king consulted the learned men about the Court , who told him that probably a FIREDRAKE was in the neighbourhood ."
96,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Now , the Firedrake is a beast , or bird , about the bigness of an elephant ."
97,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Its body is made of iron , and it is always red-hot ."
98,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"A more terrible and cruel beast can not be imagined ; for , if you go near it , you are at once broiled by the Firedrake ."
99,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the king was not ill-pleased : `` for , '' thought he , `` of course my three sons must go after the brute , the eldest first ; and , as usual , it will kill the first two , and be beaten by the youngest ."
100,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"It is a little hard on Enrico , poor boy ; but anything to get rid of that Prigio ! ''"
101,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then the king went to Prigio , and said that his country was in danger , and that he was determined to leave the crown to whichever of them would bring him the horns for it has horns and tail of the Firedrake ."
102,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` It is an awkward brute to tackle , '' the king said , `` but you are the oldest , my lad ; go where glory waits you !"
103,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Put on your armour , and be off with you ! ''"
104,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889, `` Put on your armour and be off with you ! ''
105,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,": p18.jpg -RCB- This the king said , hoping that either the Firedrake would roast Prince Prigio alive which he could easily do , as I have said ; for he is all over as hot as a red-hot poker , or that , if the prince succeeded , at least his country would be freed from the monster ."
106,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the prince , who was lying on the sofa doing sums in compound division for fun , said in the politest way : `` Thanks to the education your majesty has given me , I have learned that the Firedrake , like the siren , the fairy , and so forth , is a fabulous animal which does not exist ."
107,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But even granting , for the sake of argument , that there is a Firedrake , your majesty is well aware that there is no kind of use in sending me ."
108,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"It is always the eldest son who goes out first and comes to grief on these occasions , and it is always the third son that succeeds ."
109,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Send Alphonso '' this was the youngest brother , `` and he will do the trick at once ."
110,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"At least , if he fails , it will be most unusual , and Enrico can try his luck . ''"
111,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he went back to his arithmetic and his slate , and the king had to send for Prince Alphonso and Prince Enrico ."
112,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"They both came in very warm ; for they had been whipping tops , and the day was unusually hot ."
113,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Look here , '' said the king , `` just you two younger ones look at Prigio !"
114,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"You see how hot it is , and how coolly he takes it , and the country suffering ; and all on account of a Firedrake , you know , which has apparently built his nest not far off ."
115,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Well , I have asked that lout of a brother of yours to kill it , and he says -- '' `` That he does not believe in Firedrakes , '' interrupted Prigio ."
116,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` The weather 's warm enough without going out hunting ! ''
117,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Not believe in Firedrakes ! '' cried Alphonso .
118,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` I wonder what you do believe in !
119,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Just let me get at the creature ! '' for he was as brave as a lion .
120,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Hi ! Page , my chain-armour , helmet , lance , and buckler ! A Molinda ! A Molinda ! '' which was his war-cry ."
121,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The page ran to get the armour ; but it was so uncommonly hot that he dropped it , and put his fingers in his mouth , crying !"
122,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` You had better put on flannels , Alphonso , for this kind of work , '' said Prigio ."
123,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` And if I were you , I 'd take a light garden-engine , full of water , to squirt at the enemy . ''"
124,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Happy thought ! '' said Alphonso .
125,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` I will ! ''
126,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And off he went , kissed his dear Molinda , bade her keep a lot of dances for him there was to be a dance when he had killed the Firedrake , and then he rushed to the field !"
127,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,But he never came back any more !
128,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Everyone wept bitterly -- everyone but Prince Prigio ; for he thought it was a practical joke , and said that Alphonso had taken the opportunity to start off on his travels and see the world ."
129,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` There is some dreadful mistake , sir , '' said Prigio to the king ."
130,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` You know as well as I do that the youngest son has always succeeded , up to now ."
131,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,But I entertain great hopes of Enrico ! ''
132,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And he grinned ; for he fancied it was all nonsense , and that there were no Firedrakes ."
133,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Enrico was present when Prigio was consoling the king in this unfeeling way .
134,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Enrico , my boy , '' said his majesty , `` the task awaits you , and the honour ."
135,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"When you come back with the horns and tail of the Firedrake , you shall be crown prince ; and Prigio shall be made an usher at the Grammar School -- it is all he is fit for . ''"
136,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Enrico was not quite so confident as Alphonso had been .
137,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,He insisted on making his will ; and he wrote a poem about the pleasures and advantages of dying young .
138,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"This is part of it : The violet is a blossom sweet , That droops before the day is done -- Slain by thine overpowering heat , O Sun !"
139,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And I , like that sweet purple flower , May roast , or boil , or broil , or bake , If burned by thy terrific power , Firedrake !"
140,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"This poem comforted Enrico more or less , and he showed it to Prigio ."
141,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the prince only laughed , and said that the second line of the last verse was not very good ; for violets do not `` roast , or boil , or broil , or bake . ''"
142,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Enrico tried to improve it , but could not ."
143,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"So he read it to his cousin , Lady Kathleena , just as it was ; and she cried over it though I don't think she understood it ; and Enrico cried a little , too ."
144,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"However , next day he started , with a spear , a patent refrigerator , and a lot of the bottles people throw at fires to put them out ."
145,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,But he never came back again !
146,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"After shedding torrents of tears , the king summoned Prince Prigio to his presence ."
147,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Dastard ! '' he said .
148,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Poltroon !
149,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Your turn , which should have come first , has arrived at last ."
150,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,You must fetch me the horns and the tail of the Firedrake .
151,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Probably you will be grilled , thank goodness ; but who will give me back Enrico and Alphonso ? ''"
152,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Indeed , your majesty , '' said Prigio , `` you must permit me to correct your policy ."
153,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Your only reason for dispatching your sons in pursuit of this dangerous but I believe fabulous animal , was to ascertain which of us would most worthily succeed to your throne , at the date -- long may it be deferred ! -- of your lamented decease ."
154,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Now , there can be no further question about the matter ."
155,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"I , unworthy as I am , represent the sole hope of the royal family ."
156,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Therefore to send me after the Firedrake were both dangerous and unnecessary .
157,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Dangerous , because , if he treats me as you say he did my brothers -- my unhappy brothers , -- the throne of Pantouflia will want an heir ."
158,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But , if I do come back alive -- why , I can not be more the true heir than I am at present ; now can I ?"
159,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Ask the Lord Chief Justice , if you don't believe me . ''"
160,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"These arguments were so clearly and undeniably correct that the king , unable to answer them , withdrew into a solitary place where he could express himself with freedom , and give rein to his expression ."
161,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Meanwhile , Prince Prigio had to suffer many unpleasant things ."
162,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Though he was the crown prince and though his arguments were unanswerable , everybody shunned him for a coward ."
163,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The queen , who did not believe in Firedrakes , alone took his side ."
164,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He was not only avoided by all , but he had most disagreeable scenes with his own cousins , Lady Molinda and Lady Kathleena ."
165,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"In the garden Lady Molinda met him walking alone , and did not bow to him ."
166,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Dear Molly , '' said the prince , who liked her , `` how have I been so unfortunate as to offend you ? ''"
167,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` My name , sir , is Lady Molinda , '' she said , very proudly ; `` and you have sent your own brother to his grave ! ''"
168,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Oh , excuse me , '' said the prince , `` I am certain he has merely gone off on his travels ."
169,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He 'll come back when he 's tired : there are no Firedrakes ; a French writer says they are ` purement fabuleux , ' purely fabulous , you know . ''"
170,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889," `` My name , sir , is Lady Molinda , she said . ''"
171,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,": p29.jpg -RCB- `` Prince Alphonso has gone on his travels , and will come back when he is tired !"
172,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And was he then -- tired -- of me ? '' cried poor Molinda , bursting into tears , and forgetting her dignity ."
173,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Oh !
174,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"I beg your pardon , I never noticed ; I 'm sure I am very sorry , '' cried the prince , who , never having been in love himself , never thought of other people ."
175,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And he tried to take Molinda 's hand , but she snatched it from him and ran away through the garden to the palace , leaving Prince Prigio to feel foolish , for once , and ashamed ."
176,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"As for Lady Kathleena , she swept past him like a queen , without a word ."
177,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"So the prince , for all his cleverness , was not happy ."
178,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"After several days had gone by , the king returned from the solitary place where he had been speaking his mind ."
179,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,He now felt calmer and better ; and so at last he came back to the palace .
180,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But on seeing Prince Prigio , who was lolling in a hammock , translating Egyptian hieroglyphs into French poetry for his mother , the king broke out afresh , and made use of the most cruel and impolite expressions ."
181,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"At last , he gave orders that all the Court should pack up and move to a distant city ; and that Prince Prigio should be left alone in the palace by himself ."
182,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"For he was quite unendurable , the king said , and he could not trust his own temper when he thought of him ."
183,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And he grew so fierce , that even the queen was afraid of him now ."
184,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The poor queen cried a good deal ; Prigio being her favourite son , on account of his acknowledged ability and talent ."
185,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,But the rest of the courtiers were delighted at leaving Prince Prigio behind .
186,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"For his part , he , very good-naturedly , showed them the best and shortest road to Falkenstein , the city where they were going ; and easily proved that neither the chief secretary for geography , nor the general of the army , knew anything about the matter -- which , indeed , they did not ."
187,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The ungrateful courtiers left Prigio with hoots and yells , for they disliked him so much that they forgot he would be king one day ."
188,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He therefore reminded them of this little fact in future history , which made them feel uncomfortable enough , and then lay down in his hammock and went to sleep ."
189,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"When he wakened , the air was cold and the day was beginning to grow dark ."
190,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Prince Prigio thought he would go down and dine at a tavern in the town , for no servants had been left with him ."
191,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But what was his annoyance when he found that his boots , his sword , his cap , his cloak -- all his clothes , in fact , except those he wore , -- had been taken away by the courtiers , merely to spite him !"
192,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"His wardrobe had been ransacked , and everything that had not been carried off had been cut up , burned , and destroyed ."
193,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Never was such a spectacle of wicked mischief .
194,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,It was as if hay had been made of everything he possessed .
195,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"What was worse , he had not a penny in his pocket to buy new things ; and his father had stopped his allowance of fifty thousand pounds a month ."
196,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Can you imagine anything more cruel and unjust than this conduct ? for it was not the prince 's fault that he was so clever .
197,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,The cruel fairy had made him so .
198,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But , even if the prince had been born clever as may have happened to you , was he to be blamed for that ?"
199,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The other people were just as much in fault for being born so stupid ; but the world , my dear children , can never be induced to remember this ."
200,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"If you are clever , you will find it best not to let people know it -- if you want them to like you ."
201,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Well , here was the prince in a pretty plight ."
202,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Not a pound in his pocket , not a pair of boots to wear , not even a cap to cover his head from the rain ; nothing but cold meat to eat , and never a servant to answer the bell ."
203,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"At last he climbed up a turret-stair in the very oldest part of the castle , where he had never been before ; and at the very top was a little round room , a kind of garret ."
204,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince pushed in the door with some difficulty -- not that it was locked , but the handle was rusty , and the wood had swollen with the damp ."
205,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The room was very dark ; only the last grey light of the rainy evening came through a slit of a window , one of those narrow windows that they used to fire arrows out of in old times ."
206,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,But in the dusk the prince saw a heap of all sorts of things lying on the floor and on the table .
207,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"There were two caps ; he put one on -- an old , grey , ugly cap it was , made of felt ."
208,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"There was a pair of boots ; and he kicked off his slippers , and got into them ."
209,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"They were a good deal worn , but fitted as if they had been made for him ."
210,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"On the table was a purse with just three gold coins -- old ones , too -- in it ; and this , as you may fancy , the prince was very well pleased to put in his pocket ."
211,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"A sword , with a sword-belt , he buckled about his waist ; and the rest of the articles , a regular collection of odds and ends , he left just where they were lying ."
212,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he ran downstairs , and walked out of the hall door ."
213,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,By this time the prince was very hungry .
214,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The town was just three miles off ; but he had such a royal appetite , that he did not like to waste it on bad cookery , and the people of the royal town were bad cooks ."
215,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` I wish I were in ` The Bear , ' at Gluckstein , '' said he to himself ; for he remembered that there was a very good cook there ."
216,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But , then , the town was twenty-one leagues away -- sixty-three long miles !"
217,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"No sooner had the prince said this , and taken just three steps , than he found himself at the door of the `` Bear Inn '' at Gluckstein !"
218,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` This is the most extraordinary dream , '' said he to himself ; for he was far too clever , of course , to believe in seven-league boots ."
219,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Yet he had a pair on at that very moment , and it was they which had carried him in three strides from the palace to Gluckstein !"
220,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The truth is , that the prince , in looking about the palace for clothes , had found his way into that very old lumber-room where the magical gifts of the fairies had been thrown by his clever mother , who did not believe in them ."
221,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But this , of course , the prince did not know ."
222,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Now you should be told that seven-league boots only take those prodigious steps when you say you want to go a long distance .
223,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Otherwise they would be very inconvenient -- when you only want to cross the room , for example ."
224,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Perhaps this has not been explained to you by your governess ?
225,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Well , the prince walked into `` The Bear , '' and it seemed odd to him that nobody took any notice of him ."
226,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And yet his face was as well known as that of any man in Pantouflia , for everybody had seen it , at least in pictures ."
227,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He was so puzzled by not being attended to as usual , that he quite forgot to take off his cap ."
228,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He sat down at the table , however , and shouted '' Kellner ! '' at which all the waiters jumped , and looked round in every direction , but nobody came to him ."
229,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"At first he thought they were too busy , but presently another explanation occurred to him ."
230,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` The king , '' he said to himself , `` has threatened to execute anybody who speaks to me , or helps me in any way ."
231,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Well , I don't mean to starve in the midst of plenty , anyhow ; here goes ! ''"
232,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince rose , and went to the table in the midst of the room , where a huge roast turkey had just been placed ."
233,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He helped himself to half the breast , some sausages , chestnut stuffing , bread sauce , potatoes , and a bottle of red wine -- Burgundy ."
234,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He then went back to a table in a corner , where he dined very well , nobody taking any notice of him ."
235,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"When he had finished , he sat watching the other people dining , and smoking his cigarette ."
236,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"As he was sitting thus , a very tall man , an officer in the uniform of the Guards , came in , and , walking straight to the prince 's table , said : `` Kellner , clean this table , and bring in the bill of fare . ''"
237,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"With these words , the officer sat down suddenly in the prince 's lap , as if he did not see him at all ."
238,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He was a heavy man , and the prince , enraged at the insult , pushed him away and jumped to his feet ."
239,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"As he did so , his cap dropped off ."
240,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The officer fell on his knees at once , crying : `` Pardon , my prince , pardon !"
241,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,I never saw you ! ''
242,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,This was more than the prince could be expected to believe .
243,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Nonsense !
244,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Count Frederick von Matterhorn , '' he said ; `` you must be intoxicated ."
245,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Sir ! you have insulted your prince and your superior officer .
246,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Consider yourself under arrest !
247,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,You shall be sent to a prison to-morrow . ''
248,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"On this , the poor officer appealed piteously to everybody in the tavern ."
249,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"They all declared that they had not seen the prince , nor even had an idea that he was doing them the honour of being in the neighbourhood of their town ."
250,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"More and more offended , and convinced that there was a conspiracy to annoy and insult him , the prince shouted for the landlord , called for his bill , threw down his three pieces of gold without asking for change , and went into the street ."
251,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` It is a disgraceful conspiracy , '' he said ."
252,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` The king shall answer for this !
253,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,I shall write to the newspapers at once ! ''
254,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,He was not put in a better temper by the way in which people hustled him in the street .
255,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"They ran against him exactly as if they did not see him , and then staggered back in the greatest surprise , looking in every direction for the person they had jostled ."
256,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"In one of these encounters , the prince pushed so hard against a poor old beggar woman that she fell down ."
257,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"As he was usually most kind and polite , he pulled off his cap to beg her pardon , when , behold , the beggar woman gave one dreadful scream , and fainted !"
258,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"A crowd was collecting , and the prince , forgetting that he had thrown down all his money in the tavern , pulled out his purse ."
259,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he remembered what he had done , and expected to find it empty ; but , lo , there were three pieces of gold in it !"
260,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Overcome with surprise , he thrust the money into the woman 's hand , and put on his cap again ."
261,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"In a moment the crowd , which had been staring at him , rushed away in every direction , with cries of terror , declaring that there was a magician in the town , and a fellow who could appear and disappear at pleasure !"
262,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"By this time , you or I , or anyone who was not so extremely clever as Prince Prigio , would have understood what was the matter ."
263,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He had put on , without knowing it , not only the seven-league boots , but the cap of darkness , and had taken Fortunatus 's purse , which could never be empty , however often you took all the money out ."
264,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"All those and many other delightful wares the fairies had given him at his christening , and the prince had found them in the dark garret ."
265,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the prince was so extremely wise , and learned , and scientific , that he did not believe in fairies , nor in fairy gifts ."
266,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` It is indigestion , '' he said to himself : `` those sausages were not of the best ; and that Burgundy was extremely strong ."
267,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Things are not as they appear . ''
268,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Here , as he was arguing with himself , he was nearly run over by a splendid carriage and six , the driver of which never took the slightest notice of him ."
269,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Annoyed at this , the prince leaped up behind , threw down the two footmen , who made no resistance , and so was carried to the door of a magnificent palace ."
270,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He was determined to challenge the gentleman who was in the carriage ; but , noticing that he had a very beautiful young lady with him , whom he had never seen before , he followed them into the house , not wishing to alarm the girl , and meaning to speak to the gentleman when he found him alone ."
271,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"A great ball was going on ; but , as usual , nobody took any notice of the prince ."
272,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He walked among the guests , being careful not to jostle them , and listening to their conversation ."
273,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,It was all about himself !
274,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Everyone had heard of his disgrace , and almost everyone cried `` Serve him right ! ''"
275,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"They said that the airs he gave himself were quite unendurable -- that nothing was more rude than to be always in the right -- that cleverness might be carried far too far -- that it was better even to be born stupid `` Like the rest of you , '' thought the prince ; and , in fact , nobody had a good word for him ."
276,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Yes , one had !"
277,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,It was the pretty lady of the carriage .
278,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,I never could tell you how pretty she was .
279,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"She was tall , with cheeks like white roses blushing : she had dark hair , and very large dark-grey eyes , and her face was the kindest in the world !"
280,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince first thought how nice and good she looked , even before he thought how pretty she looked ."
281,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,She stood up for Prince Prigio when her partner would speak ill of him .
282,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"She had never seen the prince , for she was but newly come to Pantouflia ; but she declared that it was his misfortune , not his fault , to be so clever ."
283,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` And , then , think how hard they made him work at school !"
284,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Besides , '' said this kind young lady , `` I hear he is extremely handsome , and very brave ; and he has a good heart , for he was kind , I have heard , to a poor boy , and did all his examination papers for him , so that the boy passed first in everything ."
285,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And now he is Minister for Education , though he ca n't do a line of Greek prose ! ''"
286,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince blushed at this , for he knew his conduct had not been honourable ."
287,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But he at once fell over head and ears in love with the young lady , a thing he had never done in his life before , because -- he said -- `` women were so stupid ! ''"
288,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,You see he was so clever !
289,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Now , at this very moment -- when the prince , all of a sudden , was as deep in love as if he had been the stupidest officer in the room -- an extraordinary thing happened !"
290,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Something seemed to give a whirr ! in his brain , and in one instant he knew all about it !"
291,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He believed in fairies and fairy gifts , and understood that his cap was the cap of darkness , and his shoes the seven-league boots , and his purse the purse of Fortunatus !"
292,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,He had read about those things in historical books : but now he believed in them .
293,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He understood all this , and burst out laughing , which nearly frightened an old lady near him out of her wits ."
294,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Ah ! how he wished he was only in evening dress , that he might dance with the charming young lady ."
295,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But there he was , dressed just as if he were going out to hunt , if anyone could have seen him ."
296,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"So , even if he took off his cap of darkness , and became visible , he was no figure for a ball ."
297,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Once he would not have cared , but now he cared very much indeed ."
298,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,But the prince was not clever for nothing .
299,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He thought for a moment , then went out of the room , and , in three steps of the seven-league boots , was at his empty , dark , cold palace again ."
300,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He struck a light with a flint and steel , lit a torch , and ran upstairs to the garret ."
301,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The flaring light of the torch fell on the pile of `` rubbish , '' as the queen would have called it , which he turned over with eager hands ."
302,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Was there -- yes , there was another cap !"
303,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"There it lay , a handsome green one with a red feather ."
304,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince pulled off the cap of darkness , put on the other , and said : '' I wish I were dressed in my best suit of white and gold , with the royal Pantouflia diamonds ! ''"
305,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"In one moment there he was in white and gold , the greatest and most magnificent dandy in the whole world , and the handsomest man !"
306,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` How about my boots , I wonder , '' said the prince ; for his seven-league boots were stout riding-boots , not good to dance in , whereas now he was in elegant shoes of silk and gold ."
307,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He threw down the wishing cap , put on the other -- the cap of darkness -- and made three strides in the direction of Gluckstein ."
308,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But he was only three steps nearer it than he had been , and the seven-league boots were standing beside him on the floor !"
309,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` No , '' said the prince ; `` no man can be in two different pairs of boots at one and the same time !"
310,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,That 's mathematics ! ''
311,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He then hunted about in the lumber-room again till he found a small , shabby , old Persian carpet , the size of a hearthrug ."
312,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He went to his own room , took a portmanteau in his hand , sat down on the carpet , and said : `` I wish I were in Gluckstein . ''"
313,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"In a moment there he found himself ; for this was that famous carpet which Prince Hussein bought long ago , in the market at Bisnagar , and which the fairies had brought , with the other presents , to the christening of Prince Prigio ."
314,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"When he arrived at the house where the ball was going on , he put the magical carpet in the portmanteau , and left it in the cloak-room , receiving a numbered ticket in exchange ."
315,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he marched in all his glory and , of course , without the cap of darkness into the room where they were dancing ."
316,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Everybody made place for him , bowing down to the ground , and the loyal band struck up The Prince 's March !"
317,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Heaven bless our Prince Prigio !
318,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,What is there he does n't know ?
319,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Greek , Swiss , German High and Low , And the names of the mountains in Mexico , Heaven bless the prince !"
320,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He used to be very fond of this march , and the words -- some people even said he had made them himself ."
321,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But now , somehow , he did n't much like it ."
322,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He went straight to the Duke of Stumpfelbahn , the Hereditary Master of the Ceremonies , and asked to be introduced to the beautiful young lady ."
323,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"She was the daughter of the new English Ambassador , and her name was Lady Rosalind ."
324,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But she nearly fainted when she heard who it was that wished to dance with her , for she was not at all particularly clever ; and the prince had such a bad character for snubbing girls , and asking them difficult questions ."
325,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"However , it was impossible to refuse , and so she danced with the prince , and he danced very well ."
326,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then they sat out in the conservatory , among the flowers , where nobody came near them ; and then they danced again , and then the Prince took her down to supper ."
327,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And all the time he never once said , `` Have you read this ? '' or `` Have you read that ? '' or , `` What ! you never heard of Alexander the Great ? '' or Julius Caesar , or Michael Angelo , or whoever it might be -- horrid , difficult questions he used to ask ."
328,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"That was the way he used to go on : but now he only talked to the young lady about herself ; and she quite left off being shy or frightened , and asked him all about his own country , and about the Firedrake-shooting , and said how fond she was of hunting herself ."
329,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And the prince said : `` Oh , if you wish it , you shall have the horns and tail of a Firedrake to hang up in your hall , to-morrow evening ! ''"
330,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then she asked if it was not very dangerous work , Firedrake hunting ; and he said it was nothing , when you knew the trick of it : and he asked her if she would but give him a rose out of her bouquet ; and , in short , he made himself so agreeable and unaffected , that she thought him very nice indeed ."
331,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"For , even a clever person can be nice when he likes -- above all , when he is not thinking about himself ."
332,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And now the prince was thinking of nothing in the world but the daughter of the English ambassador , and how to please her ."
333,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He got introduced to her father too , and quite won his heart ; and , at last , he was invited to dine next day at the Embassy ."
334,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"In Pantouflia , it is the custom that a ball must not end while one of the royal family goes on dancing ."
335,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"This ball lasted till the light came in , and the birds were singing out of doors , and all the mothers present were sound asleep ."
336,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then nothing would satisfy the prince , but that they all should go home singing through the streets ; in fact , there never had been so merry a dance in all Pantouflia ."
337,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,The prince had made a point of dancing with almost every girl there : and he had suddenly become the most beloved of the royal family .
338,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But everything must end at last ; and the prince , putting on the cap of darkness and sitting on the famous carpet , flew back to his lonely castle ."
339,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Prince Prigio did not go to bed .
340,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"It was bright daylight , and he had promised to bring the horns and tail of a Firedrake as a present to a pretty lady ."
341,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He had said it was easy to do this ; but now , as he sat and thought over it , he did not feel so victorious ."
342,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` First , '' he said , `` where is the Firedrake ? ''"
343,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He reflected for a little , and then ran upstairs to the garret ."
344,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` It should be here ! '' he cried , tossing the fairies ' gifts about ; `` and , by George , here it is ! ''"
345,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Indeed , he had found the spyglass of carved ivory which Prince Ali , in the Arabian Nights , bought in the bazaar in Schiraz ."
346,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Now , this glass was made so that , by looking through it , you could see anybody or anything you wished , however far away ."
347,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Prigio 's first idea was to look at his lady .
348,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` But she does not expect to be looked at , '' he thought ; `` and I wo n't ! ''"
349,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"On the other hand , he determined to look at the Firedrake ; for , of course , he had no delicacy about spying on him , the brute ."
350,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince clapped the glass to his eye , stared out of window , and there , sure enough , he saw the Firedrake ."
351,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He was floating about in a sea of molten lava , on the top of a volcano ."
352,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"There he was , swimming and diving for pleasure , tossing up the flaming waves , and blowing fountains of fire out of his nostrils , like a whale spouting !"
353,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,The prince did not like the looks of him .
354,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` With all my cap of darkness , and my shoes of swiftness , and my sword of sharpness , I never could get near that beast , '' he said ; `` and if I did stalk him , I could not hurt him ."
355,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Poor little Alphonso ! poor Enrico ! what plucky fellows they were !
356,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"I fancied that there was no such thing as a Firedrake : he 's not in the Natural History books , and I thought the boys were only making fun , and would be back soon , safe and sound ."
357,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,How horrid being too clever makes one !
358,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And now , what am I to do ? ''"
359,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"What was he to do , indeed ?"
360,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,And what would you have done ?
361,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Bring the horns and tail he must , or perish in the adventure ."
362,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Otherwise , how could he meet his lady ? -- why , she would think him a mere braggart !"
363,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince sat down , and thought and thought ; and the day went on , and it was now high noon ."
364,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"At last he jumped up and rushed into the library , a room where nobody ever went except himself and the queen ."
365,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"There he turned the books upside down , in his haste , till he found an old one , by a French gentleman , Monsieur Cyrano de Bergerac ."
366,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"It was an account of a voyage to the moon , in which there is a great deal of information about matters not generally known ; for few travellers have been to the moon ."
367,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"In that book , Prince Prigio fancied he would find something he half remembered , and that would be of use to him ."
368,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,And he did !
369,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"So you see that cleverness , and minding your book , have some advantages , after all ."
370,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"For here the prince learned that there is a very rare beast , called a Remora , which is at least as cold as the Firedrake is hot !"
371,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Now , '' thought he , '' if I can only make these two fight , why the Remora may kill the Firedrake , or take the heat out of him , at least , so that I may have a chance . ''"
372,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he seized the ivory glass , clapped it to his eye , and looked for the Remora ."
373,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Just the tip of his nose , as white as snow and as smooth as ice , was sticking out of a chink in a frozen mountain , not far from the burning mountain of the Firedrake ."
374,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Hooray ! '' said the prince softly to himself ; and he jumped like mad into the winged shoes of swiftness , stuck on the cap of darkness , girdled himself with the sword of sharpness , and put a good slice of bread , with some cold tongue , in a wallet , which he slung on his back ."
375,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Never you fight , if you can help it , except with plenty of food to keep you going and in good heart ."
376,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then off he flew , and soon he reached the volcano of the Firedrake ."
377,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"It was dreadfully hot , even high up in the air , where the prince hung invisible ."
378,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Great burning stones were tossed up by the volcano , and nearly hit him several times ."
379,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Moreover , the steam and smoke , and the flames which the Firedrake spouted like foam from his nostrils , would have daunted even the bravest man ."
380,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The sides of the hill , too , were covered with the blackened ashes of his victims , whom he had roasted when they came out to kill him ."
381,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The garden-engine of poor little Alphonso was lying in the valley , all broken and useless ."
382,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the Firedrake , as happy as a wild duck on a lonely loch , was rolling and diving in the liquid flame , all red-hot and full of frolic ."
383,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Hi ! '' shouted the prince .
384,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The Firedrake rose to the surface , his horns as red as a red crescent - moon , only bigger , and lashing the fire with his hoofs and his blazing tail ."
385,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Who 's there ? '' he said in a hoarse , angry voice ."
386,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Just let me get at you ! ''
387,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` It 's me , '' answered the prince ."
388,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"It was the first time he had forgotten his grammar , but he was terribly excited ."
389,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` What do you want ? '' grunted the beast .
390,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` I wish I could see you '' ; and , horrible to relate , he rose on a pair of wide , flaming wings , and came right at the prince , guided by the sound of his voice ."
391,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Now , the prince had never heard that Firedrakes could fly ; indeed , he had never believed in them at all , till the night before ."
392,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"For a moment he was numb with terror ; then he flew down like a stone to the very bottom of the hill , and shouted : `` Hi ! ''"
393,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Well , '' grunted the Firedrake , `` what 's the matter ?"
394,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Why ca n't you give a civil answer to a civil question ? ''
395,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Will you go back to your hole and swear , on your honour as a Firedrake , to listen quietly ? ''"
396,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` On my sacred word of honour , '' said the beast , casually scorching an eagle that flew by into ashes ."
397,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The cinders fell , jingling and crackling , round the prince in a little shower ."
398,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then the Firedrake dived back , with an awful splash of flame , and the mountain roared round him ."
399,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince now flew high above him , and cried : `` A message from the Remora ."
400,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,He says you are afraid to fight him . ''
401,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Do n't know him , '' grunted the Firedrake ."
402,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` He sends you his glove , '' said Prince Prigio , `` as a challenge to mortal combat , till death do you part . ''"
403,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Then he dropped his own glove into the fiery lake .
404,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Does he ? '' yelled the Firedrake .
405,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Just let me get at him ! '' and he scrambled out , all red-hot as he was ."
406,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` I 'll go and tell him you 're coming , '' said the prince ; and with two strides he was over the frozen mountain of the Remora ."
407,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The hill of the Remora was one solid mass of frozen steel , and the cold rushed out of it like the breath of some icy beast , which indeed it was ."
408,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"All around were things like marble statues of men in armour : they were the dead bodies of the knights , horses and all , who had gone out of old to fight the Remora , and who had been frosted up by him ."
409,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince felt his blood stand still , and he grew faint ; but he took heart , for there was no time to waste ."
410,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Yet he could nowhere see the Remora .
411,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Hi ! '' shouted the prince .
412,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then , from a narrow chink at the bottom of the smooth , black hill , -- a chink no deeper than that under a door , but a mile wide , -- stole out a hideous head !"
413,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"It was as flat as the head of a skate-fish , it was deathly pale , and two chill-blue eyes , dead-coloured like stones , looked out of it ."
414,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then there came a whisper , like the breath of the bitter east wind on a winter day : `` Where are you , and how can I come to you ? ''"
415,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Here I am ! '' said the prince from the top of the hill .
416,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then the flat , white head set itself against the edge of the chink from which it had peeped , and slowly , like the movement of a sheet of ice , it slipped upwards and curled upwards , and up , and up !"
417,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"There seemed no end to it at all ; and it moved horribly , without feet , holding on by its own frost to the slippery side of the frozen hill ."
418,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Now all the lower part of the black hill was covered with the horrid white thing coiled about it in smooth , flat , shiny coils ; and still the head was higher than the rest ; and still the icy cold came nearer and nearer , like Death ."
419,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince almost fainted : everything seemed to swim ; and in one moment more he would have fallen stiff on the mountain-top , and the white head would have crawled over him , and the cold coils would have slipped over him and turned him to stone ."
420,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And still the thing slipped up , from the chink under the mountain ."
421,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the prince made a great effort ; he moved , and in two steps he was far away , down in the valley where it was not so very cold ."
422,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Hi ! '' he shouted , as soon as his tongue could move within his chattering teeth ."
423,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"There came a clear , hissing answer , like frozen words dropping round him : `` Wait till I come down ."
424,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,What do you want ? ''
425,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then the white folds began to slide , like melting ice , from the black hill ."
426,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Prince Prigio felt the air getting warmer behind him , and colder in front of him ."
427,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He looked round , and there were the trees beginning to blacken in the heat , and the grass looking like a sea of fire along the plains ; for the Firedrake was coming !"
428,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince just took time to shout , `` The Firedrake is going to pay you a visit ! '' and then he soared to the top of a neighbouring hill , and looked on at what followed ."
429,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,It was an awul sight to behold !
430,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"When the Remora heard the name of the Firedrake , his hated enemy , he slipped with wonderful speed from the cleft of the mountain into the valley ."
431,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"On and on and on he poured over rock and tree , as if a frozen river could slide downhill ; on and on , till there were miles of him stretching along the valley -- miles of the smooth - ribbed , icy creature , crawling and slipping forwards ."
432,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The green trees dropped their leaves as he advanced ; the birds fell down dead from the sky , slain by his frosty breath !"
433,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But , fast as the Remora stole forward , the Firedrake came quicker yet , flying and clashing his fiery wings ."
434,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"At last they were within striking distance ; and the Firedrake , stooping from the air , dashed with his burning horns and flaming feet slap into the body of the Remora ."
435,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then there rose a steam so dreadful , such a white yet fiery vapour of heat , that no one who had not the prince 's magic glass could have seen what happened ."
436,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"With horrible grunts and roars the Firedrake tried to burn his way right through the flat body of the Remora , and to chase him to his cleft in the rock ."
437,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the Remora , hissing terribly , and visibly melting away in places , yet held his ground ; and the prince could see his cold white folds climbing slowly up the hoofs of the Firedrake -- up and up , till they reached his knees , and the great burning beast roared like a hundred bulls with the pain ."
438,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then up the Firedrake leaped , and hovering on his fiery wings , he lighted in the midst of the Remora 's back , and dashed into it with his horns ."
439,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the flat , cruel head writhed backwards , and , slowly bending over on itself , the wounded Remora slid greedily to fasten again on the limbs of the Firedrake ."
440,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Meanwhile , the prince , safe on his hill , was lunching on the loaf and the cold tongue he had brought with him ."
441,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Go it , Remora !"
442,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Go it , Firedrake ! you 're gaining ."
443,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Give it him , Remora ! '' he shouted in the wildest excitement ."
444,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Nobody had ever seen such a battle ; he had it all to himself , and he never enjoyed anything more ."
445,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He hated the Remora so much , that he almost wished the Firedrake could beat it ; for the Firedrake was the more natural beast of the pair ."
446,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Still , he was alarmed when he saw that the vast flat body of the Remora was now slowly coiling backwards , backwards , into the cleft below the hill ; while a thick wet mist showed how cruelly it had suffered ."
447,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the Firedrake , too , was in an unhappy way ; for his legs were now cold and black , his horns were black also , though his body , especially near the heart , glowed still like red-hot iron ."
448,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Go it , Remora ! '' cried the prince : `` his legs are giving way ; he 's groggy on his pins !"
449,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"One more effort , and he wo n't be able to move ! ''"
450,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Encouraged by this advice , the white , slippery Remora streamed out of his cavern again , more and more of him uncoiling , as if the mountain were quite full of him ."
451,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He had lost strength , no doubt : for the steam and mist went up from him in clouds , and the hissing of his angry voice grew fainter ; but so did the roars of the Firedrake ."
452,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Presently they sounded more like groans ; and at last the Remora slipped up his legs above the knees , and fastened on his very heart of fire ."
453,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then the Firedrake stood groaning like a black bull , knee-deep in snow ; and still the Remora climbed and climbed ."
454,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Go it now , Firedrake ! '' shouted the prince ; for he knew that if the Remora won , it would be too cold for him to draw near the place , and cut off the Firedrake 's head and tail ."
455,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Go it , Drake ! he 's slackening ! '' cried the prince again ; and the brave Firedrake made one last furious effort , and rising on his wings , dropped just on the spine of his enemy ."
456,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The wounded Remora curled back his head again on himself , and again crawled , steaming terribly , towards his enemy ."
457,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,But the struggle was too much for the gallant Remora .
458,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The flat , cruel head moved slower ; the steam from his thousand wounds grew fiercer ; and he gently breathed his last just as the Firedrake , too , fell over and lay exhausted ."
459,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"With one final roar , like the breath of a thousand furnaces , the Firedrake expired ."
460,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince , watching from the hill-top , could scarcely believe that these two awful scourges of Nature , which had so long devastated his country , were actually dead ."
461,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But when he had looked on for half-an-hour , and only a river ran where the Remora had been , while the body of the Firedrake lay stark and cold , he hurried to the spot ."
462,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Drawing the sword of sharpness , he hacked off , at two blows , the iron head and the tail of the Firedrake ."
463,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"They were a weary weight to carry ; but in a few strides of the shoes of swiftness he was at his castle , where he threw down his burden , and nearly fainted with excitement and fatigue ."
464,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the castle clock struck half-past seven ; dinner was at eight , and the poor prince crawled on hands and knees to the garret ."
465,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Here he put on the wishing-cap ; wished for a pint of champagne , a hot bath , and his best black velvet and diamond suit ."
466,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"In a moment these were provided ; he bathed , dressed , drank a glass of wine , packed up the head and tail of the Firedrake , sat down on the flying carpet , and knocked at the door of the English ambassador as the clocks were striking eight in Gluckstein ."
467,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Punctuality is the politeness of princes ! and a prince is polite , when he is in love !"
468,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince was received at the door by a stout porter and led into the hall , where several butlers met him , and he laid the mortal remains of the Firedrake under the cover of the flying carpet ."
469,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he was led upstairs ; and he made his bow to the pretty lady , who , of course , made him a magnificent courtesy ."
470,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,She seemed prettier and kinder than ever .
471,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince was so happy , that he never noticed how something went wrong about the dinner ."
472,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The ambassador looked about , and seemed to miss someone , and spoke in a low voice to one of the servants , who answered also in a low voice , and what he said seemed to displease the ambassador ."
473,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the prince was so busy in talking to his lady , and in eating his dinner too , that he never observed anything unusual ."
474,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,He had never been at such a pleasant dinner !
475,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"When the ladies left , and the prince and the other gentlemen were alone , the ambassador appeared more gloomy than ever ."
476,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"At last he took the prince into a corner , on pretence of showing him a rare statue ."
477,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Does your royal highness not know , '' he asked , `` that you are in considerable danger ? ''"
478,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Still ? '' said the prince , thinking of the Firedrake ."
479,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The ambassador did not know what he meant , for he had never heard of the fight , but he answered gravely : `` Never more than now . ''"
480,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he showed the prince two proclamations , which had been posted all about the town ."
481,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Here is the first : TO ALL LOYAL SUBJECTS .
482,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Whereas , Our eldest son , Prince Prigio , hath of late been guilty of several high crimes and misdemeanours ."
483,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"First : By abandoning the post of danger against the Firedrake , whereby our beloved sons , Prince Alphonso and Prince Enrico , have perished , and been overdone by that monster ."
484,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Secondly : By attending an unseemly revel in the town of Gluckstein , where he brawled in the streets ."
485,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Thirdly : By trying to seduce away the hearts of our loyal subjects in that city , and to blow up a party against our crown and our peace ."
486,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"This is to give warning , That whoever consorts with , comforts , aids , or abets the said Prince Prigio , is thereby a partner in his treason ; and That a reward of FIVE THOUSAND PURSES will be given to whomsoever brings the said prince , alive , to our Castle of Falkenstein ."
487,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,And here is the second proclamation : REWARD .
488,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Whereas , Our dominions have lately been devastated by a Firedrake the Salamander Furiosus of Buffon ; This is to advise all , That whosoever brings the horns and tail of the said Firedrake to our Castle of Falkenstein , shall receive FIVE THOUSAND PURSES , the position of Crown Prince , with the usual perquisites , and the hand of the king 's niece , the Lady Molinda ."
489,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` H 'm , '' said the prince ; `` I did not think his majesty wrote so well ; '' and he would have liked to say , `` Do n't you think we might join the ladies . ''"
490,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` But , sir , '' said the ambassador , `` the streets are lined with soldiers ; and I know not how you have escaped them ."
491,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Here , under my roof , you are safe for the moment ; but a prolonged stay -- excuse my inhospitality -- could not but strain the harmonious relations which prevail between the Government of Pantouflia and that which I have the honour to represent . ''"
492,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` We don't want to fight ; and no more , I think , do you , '' said the prince , smiling ."
493,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Then how does your royal highness mean to treat the proclamations ? ''
494,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Why , by winning these ten thousand purses ."
495,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"I can tell you 1,000,000 pounds is worth having , '' said the prince ."
496,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` I 'll deliver up the said prince , alive , at Falkenstein this very night ; also the horns and tail of the said Firedrake ."
497,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,But I don't want to marry my Cousin Molly . ''
498,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` May I remind your royal highness that Falkenstein is three hundred miles away ?
499,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Moreover , my head butler , Benson , disappeared from the house before dinner , and I fear he went to warn Captain Kopzoffski that you are here ! ''"
500,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` That is nothing , '' said the prince ; `` but , my dear Lord Kelso , may I not have the pleasure of presenting Lady Rosalind with a little gift , a Philippine which I lost to her last night , merely the head and tail of a Firedrake which I stalked this morning ? ''"
501,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The ambassador was so astonished that he ran straight upstairs , forgetting his manners , and crying : `` Linda !"
502,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Linda ! come down at once ; here 's a surprise for you ! ''
503,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Lady Rosalind came sweeping down , with a smile on her kind face ."
504,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"She guessed what it was , though the prince had said nothing about it at dinner ."
505,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Lead the way , your royal highness ! '' cried the ambassador ; and the prince , offering Lady Rosalind his arm , went out into the hall , where he saw neither his carpet nor the horns and tail of the Firedrake !"
506,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He turned quite pale , and said : `` Will you kindly ask the servants where the little Persian prayer-rug and the parcel which I brought with me have been placed ? ''"
507,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Lord Kelso rang the bell , and in came all the servants , with William , the under-butler , at their head ."
508,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` William , '' said his lordship , `` where have you put his royal highness 's parcel and his carpet ? ''"
509,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Please , your lordship , '' said William , `` we think Benson have took them away with him . ''"
510,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` And where is Benson ? ''
511,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` We don't know , your lordship ."
512,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,We think he have been come for ! ''
513,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Come for -- by whom ? ''
514,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"William stammered , and seemed at a loss for a reply ."
515,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Quick ! answer ! what do you know about it ? ''
516,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"William said at last , rather as if he were making a speech ."
517,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Your royaliness , and my lords and ladies , it was like this ."
518,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"His royaliness comed in with a rug over his arm , and summat under it ."
519,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And he lays it down on that there seat , and Thomas shows him into the droring - room ."
520,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Then Benson says : ` Dinner 'll be ready in five minutes ; how tired I do feel ! '
521,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he takes the libbuty of sitting hisself down on his royaliness 's rug , and he says , asking your pardon , ` I 've had about enough of service here ."
522,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"I 'm about tired , and I thinks of bettering myself ."
523,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"I wish I was at the king 's court , and butler . '"
524,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But before the words was out of his mouth , off he flies like a shot through the open door , and his royaliness 's parcel with him ."
525,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"I run to the door , and there he was , flying right hover the town , in a northerly direction ."
526,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And that 's all I know ; for I would not tell a lie , not if it was never so ."
527,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And me , and Thomas -- as did n't see it , -- and cook , we thinks as how Benson was come for ."
528,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And cook says as she don't wonder at it , neither ; for a grumblinger , more ill-conditioneder -- '' `` Thank you , William , '' said Lord Kelso ; `` that will do ; you can go , for the present . ''"
529,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince said nothing , the ambassador said nothing , Lady Rosalind said never a word till they were in the drawing-room ."
530,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"It was a lovely warm evening , and the French windows were wide open on the balcony , which looked over the town and away north to the hills ."
531,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Below them flowed the clear , green water of the Gluckthal ."
532,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,And still nobody said a word .
533,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"At last the prince spoke : `` This is a very strange story , Lord Kelso ! ''"
534,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Very , sir ! '' said the ambassador ."
535,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` But true , '' added the prince ; `` at least , there is no reason in the nature of things why it should n't be true . ''"
536,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` I can hardly believe , sir , that the conduct of Benson , whom I always found a most respectable man , deserved -- '' `` That he should be ` come for , ' '' said the prince ."
537,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Oh , no ; it was a mere accident , and might have happened to any of us who chanced to sit down on my carpet . ''"
538,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And then the prince told them , shortly , all about it : how the carpet was one of a number of fairy properties , which had been given him at his christening ; and how so long a time had gone by before he discovered them ; and how , probably , the carpet had carried the butler where he had said he wanted to go , namely -- to the king 's Court at Falkenstein ."
539,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` It would not matter so much , '' added the prince , `` only I had relied on making my peace with his majesty , my father , by aid of those horns and that tail ."
540,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He was set on getting them ; and if the Lady Rosalind had not expressed a wish for them , they would to-day have been in his possession . ''"
541,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Oh , sir , you honour us too highly , '' murmured Lady Rosalind ; and the prince blushed and said : `` Not at all !"
542,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Impossible ! ''
543,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then , of course , the ambassador became quite certain that his daughter was admired by the crown prince , who was on bad terms with the king of the country ; and a more uncomfortable position for an ambassador -- however , they are used to them ."
544,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` What on earth am I to do with the young man ? '' he thought .
545,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` He ca n't stay here for ever ; and without his carpet he ca n't get away , for the soldiers have orders to seize him as soon as he appears in the street ."
546,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And in the meantime Benson will be pretending that he killed the Firedrake -- for he must have got to Falkenstein by now , -- and they will be for marrying him to the king 's niece , and making my butler crown prince to the kingdom of Pantouflia !"
547,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,It is dreadful ! ''
548,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Now all this time the prince was on the balcony , telling Lady Rosalind all about how he got the Firedrake done for , in the most modest way ; for , as he said : '' I did n't kill him : and it is really the Remora , poor fellow , who should marry Molly ; but he 's dead . ''"
549,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"At this very moment there was a whizz in the air : something shot past them , and , through the open window , the king , the queen , Benson , and the mortal remains of the Firedrake were shot into the ambassador 's drawing - room !"
550,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,The first who recovered his voice and presence of mind was Benson .
551,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Did your lordship ring for coffee ? '' he asked , quietly ; and when he was told `` Yes , '' he bowed and withdrew , with majestic composure ."
552,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"When he had gone , the prince threw himself at the king 's feet , crying : `` Pardon , pardon , my liege ! ''"
553,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Do n't speak to me , sir ! '' answered the king , very angrily ; and the poor prince threw himself at the feet of the queen ."
554,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But she took no notice of him whatever , no more than if he had been a fairy ; and the prince heard her murmur , as she pinched her royal arms : `` I shall waken presently ; this is nothing out of the way for a dream ."
555,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Dr. Rumpfino ascribes it to imperfect nutrition . ''
556,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"All this time , the Lady Rosalind , as pale as a marble statue , was leaning against the side of the open window ."
557,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince thought he could do nothing wiser than go and comfort her , so he induced her to sit down on a chair in the balcony , -- for he felt that he was not wanted in the drawing - room ; -- and soon they were talking happily about the stars , which had begun to appear in the summer night ."
558,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Meanwhile , the ambassador had induced the king to take a seat ; but there was no use in talking to the queen ."
559,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` It would be a miracle , '' she said to herself , `` and miracles do not happen ; therefore this has not happened ."
560,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Presently , I shall wake up in my own bed at Falkenstein . ''"
561,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Now , Benson , William , and Thomas brought in the coffee , but the queen took no notice ."
562,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"When they went away , the rest of the company slipped off quietly , and the king was left alone with the ambassador ; for the queen could hardly be said to count ."
563,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` You want to know all about it , I suppose ? '' said his majesty , in a sulky voice ."
564,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Well , you have a right to it , and I shall tell you ."
565,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"We were just sitting down to dinner at Falkenstein , rather late , -- hours get later every year , I think -- when I heard a row in the premises , and the captain of the guard , Colonel McDougal , came and told us that a man had arrived with the horns and tail of the Firedrake , and was claiming the reward ."
566,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Her majesty and I rose and went into the outer court , where we found , sitting on that carpet with a glass of beer in his hand , a respectable - looking upper servant , whom I recognised as your butler ."
567,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He informed us that he had just killed the beast , and showed us the horns and tail , sure enough ; there they are !"
568,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The tail is like the iron handle of a pump , but the horns are genuine ."
569,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"A pair were thrown up by a volcano , in my great - grandfather 's time , Giglio I. Excellent coffee this , of yours ! ''"
570,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,The ambassador bowed .
571,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Well , we asked him where he killed the Firedrake , and he said in a garden near Gluckstein ."
572,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he began to speak about the reward , and the ` perkisits , ' as he called them , which it seems he had read about in my proclamation ."
573,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Rather a neat thing ; drew it up myself , '' added his majesty ."
574,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Very much to the point , '' said the ambassador , wondering what the king was coming to ."
575,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Glad you like it , '' said the king , much pleased ."
576,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Well , where was I ?"
577,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Oh , yes ; your man said he had killed the creature in a garden , quite near Gluckstein ."
578,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"I did n't much like the whole affair : he is an alien , you see ; and then there was my niece , Molinda -- poor girl , she was certain to give trouble ."
579,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Her heart is buried , if I may say so , with poor Alphonso ."
580,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the queen is a very remarkable woman -- very remarkable -- '' `` Very ! '' said the Ambassador , with perfect truth . ''"
581,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"` Caitiff ! ' she cries to your butler ; '' his majesty went on , '' ` perjured knave , thou liest in thy throat !"
582,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Gluckstein is a hundred leagues from here , and how sayest thou that thou slewest the monster , and camest hither in a few hours ' space ? '"
583,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"This had not occurred to me , -- I am a plain king , but I at once saw the force of her majesty 's argument ."
584,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"` Yes , ' said I ; ` how did you manage it ? '"
585,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But he -- your man , I mean -- was not a bit put out ."
586,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"` Why , your majesty , ' says he , ' I just sat down on that there bit of carpet , wished I was here , and here I ham ."
587,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And I 'd be glad , having had the trouble , -- and my time not being my own , -- to see the colour of them perkisits , according to the proclamation . '"
588,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"On this her majesty grew more indignant , if possible ."
589,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"` Nonsense ! ' she cried ; ' a story out of the Arabian Nights is not suited for a modern public , and fails to win aesthetic credence . '"
590,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,These were her very words . ''
591,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Her majesty 's expressions are ever choice and appropriate , '' said the Ambassador . ''"
592,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"` Sit down there , on the carpet , knave , ' she went on ; ` ourself and consort ' -- meaning me -- ` will take our places by thy side , and I shall wish us in Gluckstein , at thy master 's !"
593,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"When the experiment has failed , thy head shall from thy shoulders be shorn ! '"
594,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"So your man merely said , ` Very well , mum , -- your majesty , I mean , ' and sat down ."
595,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The queen took her place at the edge of the carpet ; I sat between her and the butler , and she said , ' I wish we were in Gluckstein ! '"
596,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then we rose , flew through the air at an astonishing pace , and here we are !"
597,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"So I suppose the rest of the butler 's tale is true , which I regret ; but a king 's word is sacred , and he shall take the place of that sneak , Prigio ."
598,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But as we left home before dinner , and as yours is over , may I request your lordship to believe that I should be delighted to take something cold ? ''"
599,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The ambassador at once ordered a sumptuous collation , to which the king did full justice ; and his majesty was shown to the royal chamber , as he complained of fatigue ."
600,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The queen accompanied him , remarking that she was sound asleep , but would waken presently ."
601,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Neither of them said `` Good-night '' to the prince .
602,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Indeed , they did not see him again , for he was on the balcony with Lady Rosalind ."
603,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"They found a great deal to say to each other , and at last the prince asked her to be his wife ; and she said that if the king and her father gave their permission -- why , then she would !"
604,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"After this she went to bed ; and the prince , who had not slept at all the night before , felt very sleepy also ."
605,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,But he knew that first he had something that must be done .
606,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"So he went into the drawing-room , took his carpet , and wished to be -- now , where do you suppose ?"
607,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Beside the dead body of the Firedrake !
608,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"There he was in a moment ; and dreadful the body looked , lying stark and cold in the white moonshine ."
609,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then the prince cut off its four hoofs , put them in his wallet , and with these he flew back in a second , and met the ambassador just as he came from ushering the king to bed ."
610,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then the prince was shown his own room , where he locked up the hoofs , the carpet , the cap of darkness , and his other things in an iron box ; and so he went to bed and dreamed of his Lady Rosalind ."
611,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"When they all wakened next morning , their first ideas were confused ."
612,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"It is often confusing to waken in a strange bed , much more so when you have flown through the air , like the king , the queen , and Benson the butler ."
613,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"For her part , the queen was the most perplexed of all ; for she did undeniably wake , and yet she was not at home , where she had expected to be ."
614,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"However , she was a determined woman , and stood to it that nothing unusual was occurring ."
615,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The butler made up his mind to claim the crown princeship and the hand of the Lady Molinda ; because , as he justly remarked to William , here was such a chance to better himself as might not soon come in his way again ."
616,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"As for the king , he was only anxious to get back to Falkenstein , and have the whole business settled in a constitutional manner ."
617,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The ambassador was not sorry to get rid of the royal party ; and it was proposed that they should all sit down on the flying carpet , and wish themselves at home again ."
618,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the queen would not hear of it : she said it was childish and impossible ; so the carriage was got ready for her , and she started without saying a word of good-bye to anyone ."
619,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The king , Benson , and the prince were not so particular , and they simply flew back to Falkenstein in the usual way , arriving there at 11.35 -- a week before her majesty ."
620,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The king at once held a Court ; the horns and tail of the monster were exhibited amidst general interest , and Benson and the prince were invited to state their claims ."
621,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Benson 's evidence was taken first .
622,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,He declined to say exactly where or how he killed the Firedrake .
623,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"There might be more of them left , he remarked , -- young ones , that would take a lot of killing , -- and he refused to part with his secret ."
624,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Only he claimed the reward , which was offered , if you remember , not to the man who killed the beast , but to him who brought its horns and tail ."
625,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"This was allowed by the lawyers present to be very sound law ; and Benson was cheered by the courtiers , who decidedly preferred him to Prigio , and who , besides , thought he was going to be crown prince ."
626,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"As for Lady Molinda , she was torn by the most painful feelings ; for , much as she hated Prigio , she could not bear the idea of marrying Benson ."
627,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Yet one or the other choice seemed certain .
628,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Unhappy lady !
629,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Perhaps no girl was ever more strangely beset by misfortune !
630,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Prince Prigio was now called on to speak .
631,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He admitted that the reward was offered for bringing the horns and tail , not for killing the monster ."
632,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,But were the king 's intentions to go for nothing ?
633,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"When a subject only meant well , of course he had to suffer ; but when a king said one thing , was he not to be supposed to have meant another ?"
634,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Any fellow with a waggon could bring the horns and tail ; the difficult thing was to kill the monster .
635,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"If Benson 's claim was allowed , the royal prerogative of saying one thing and meaning something else was in danger ."
636,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"On hearing this argument , the king so far forgot himself as to cry , `` Bravo , well said ! '' and to clap his hands , whereon all the courtiers shouted and threw up their hats ."
637,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince then said that whoever had killed the monster could , of course , tell where to find him , and could bring his hoofs ."
638,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,He was ready to do this himself .
639,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Was Mr. Benson equally ready ?
640,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"On this being interpreted to him -- for he did not speak Pantouflian -- Benson grew pale with horror , but fell back on the proclamation ."
641,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He had brought the horns and tail , and so he must have the perquisites , and the Lady Molinda !"
642,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The king 's mind was so much confused by this time , that he determined to leave it to the Lady Molinda herself ."
643,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Which of them will you have , my dear ? '' he asked , in a kind voice ."
644,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,But poor Molinda merely cried .
645,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Then his majesty was almost driven to say that he would give the reward to whoever produced the hoofs by that day week .
646,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But no sooner had he said this than the prince brought them out of his wallet , and displayed them in open Court ."
647,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"This ended the case ; and Benson , after being entertained with sherry and sandwiches in the steward 's room , was sent back to his master ."
648,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,And I regret to say that his temper was not at all improved by his failure to better himself .
649,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"On the contrary , he was unusually cross and disagreeable for several days ; but we must , perhaps , make some allowance for his disappointment ."
650,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But if Benson was irritated , and suffered from the remarks of his fellow - servants , I do not think we can envy Prince Prigio ."
651,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Here he was , restored to his position indeed , but by no means to the royal favour ."
652,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"For the king disliked him as much as ever , and was as angry as ever about the deaths of Enrico and Alphonso ."
653,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Nay , he was even more angry ; and , perhaps , not without reason ."
654,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He called up Prigio before the whole Court , and thereon the courtiers cheered like anything , but the king cried : `` Silence !"
655,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"McDougal , drag the first man that shouts to the serpent-house in the zoological gardens , and lock him up with the rattlesnakes ! ''"
656,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,After that the courtiers were very quiet .
657,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Prince , '' said the king , as Prigio bowed before the throne , `` you are restored to your position , because I can not break my promise ."
658,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,But your base and malevolent nature is even more conspicuously manifest in your selfish success than in your previous dastardly contempt of duty .
659,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Why , confound you ! '' cried the king , dropping the high style in which he had been speaking , and becoming the father , not the monarch , -- `` why , if you could kill the Firedrake , did you let your poor little brothers go and be b -- b -- b -- broiled ?"
660,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Eh ! what do you say , you sneak ?"
661,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,` You did n't believe there were any Firedrakes ? '
662,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,That just comes of your eternal conceit and arrogance !
663,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,If you were clever enough to kill the creature -- and I admit that -- you were clever enough to know that what everybody said must be true .
664,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,` You have not generally found it so ? '
665,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Well , you have this time , and let it be a lesson to you ; not that there is much comfort in that , for it is not likely you will ever have such another chance '' -- exactly the idea that had occurred to Benson ."
666,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Here the king wept , among the tears of the lord chief justice , the poet laureate who had been awfully frightened when he heard of the rattlesnakes , the maids of honour , the chaplain royal , and everyone but Colonel McDougal , a Scottish soldier of fortune , who maintained a military reserve ."
667,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"When his majesty had recovered , he said to Prigio who had not been crying , he was too much absorbed : `` A king 's word is his bond ."
668,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Bring me a pen , somebody , and my cheque-book . ''"
669,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The royal cheque-book , bound in red morocco , was brought in by eight pages , with ink and a pen ."
670,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"His majesty then filled up and signed the following satisfactory document -- Ah ! my children , how I wish Mr. Arrowsmith would do as much for me ! -RRB-"
671,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,": `` There ! '' said his majesty , crossing his cheque and throwing sand over it , for blotting-paper had not yet been invented ; `` there , take that , and be off with you ! ''"
672,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Prince Prigio was respectfully but rapidly obeying his royal command , for he thought he had better cash the royal cheque as soon as possible , when his majesty yelled : `` Hi ! here ! come back !"
673,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,I forgot something ; you 've got to marry Molinda ! ''
674,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince had gone some way , when the king called after him ."
675,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"How he wished he had the seven-league boots on , or that he had the cap of darkness in his pocket !"
676,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"If he had been so lucky , he would now have got back to Gluckstein , and crossed the border with Lady Rosalind ."
677,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"A million of money may not seem much , but a pair of young people who really love each other could live happily on less than the cheque he had in his pocket ."
678,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"However , the king shouted very loud , as he always did when he meant to be obeyed , and the prince sauntered slowly back again ."
679,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Prigio ! '' said his majesty , `` where were you off to ?"
680,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Do n't you remember that this is your wedding-day ?
681,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"My proclamation offered , not only the money which you have , but the hand of the Lady Molinda , which the Court chaplain will presently make your own ."
682,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"I congratulate you , sir ; Molinda is a dear girl . ''"
683,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` I have the highest affection and esteem for my cousin , sir , '' said the prince , `` but -- '' `` I 'll never marry him ! '' cried poor Molinda , kneeling at the throne , where her streaming eyes and hair made a pretty and touching picture ."
684,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Never !
685,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,I despise him ! ''
686,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` I was about to say , sir , '' the prince went on , `` that I can not possibly have the pleasure of wedding my cousin . ''"
687,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` The family gibbet , I presume , is in good working order ? '' asked the king of the family executioner , a tall gaunt man in black and scarlet , who was only employed in the case of members of the blood royal ."
688,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Never better , sire , '' said the man , bowing with more courtliness than his profession indicated ."
689,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Very well , '' said the king ; `` Prince Prigio , you have your choice ."
690,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"There is the gallows , here is Lady Molinda ."
691,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"My duty is painful , but clear ."
692,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,A king 's word can not be broken .
693,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Molly , or the gibbet ! ''"
694,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince bowed respectfully to Lady Molinda : `` Madam , my cousin , '' said he , `` your clemency will excuse my answer , and you will not misinterpret the apparent discourtesy of my conduct ."
695,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"I am compelled , most unwillingly , to slight your charms , and to select the Extreme Rigour of the Law ."
696,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Executioner , lead on !"
697,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Do your duty ; for me , Prigio est pret ; '' -- for this was his motto , and meant that he was ready ."
698,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Poor Lady Molinda could not but be hurt by the prince 's preference for death over marriage to her , little as she liked him ."
699,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Is life , then , so worthless ? and is Molinda so terrible a person that you prefer those arms , '' and she pointed to the gibbet , `` to these ? '' -- here she held out her own , which were very white , round and pretty : for Molinda was a good-hearted girl , she could not bear to see Prigio put to death ; and then , perhaps , she reflected that there are worse positions than the queenship of Pantouflia ."
700,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,For Alphonso was gone -- crying would not bring him back .
701,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Ah , Madam ! '' said the prince , `` you are forgiving -- '' `` For you are brave ! '' said Molinda , feeling quite a respect for him ."
702,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` But neither your heart nor mine is ours to give .
703,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Since mine was another 's , I understand too well the feeling of yours !"
704,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Do not let us buy life at the price of happiness and honour . ''
705,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then , turning to the king , the prince said : `` Sir , is there no way but by death or marriage ?"
706,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"You say you can not keep half only of your promise ; and that , if I accept the reward , I must also unite myself with my unwilling cousin ."
707,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Can not the whole proclamation be annulled , and will you consider the bargain void if I tear up this flimsy scroll ? ''"
708,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And here the prince fluttered the cheque for 1,000,000 pounds in the air ."
709,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"For a moment the king was tempted ; but then he said to himself : `` Never mind , it 's only an extra penny on the income-tax . ''"
710,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then , `` Keep your dross , '' he shouted , meaning the million ; `` but let me keep my promise ."
711,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"To chapel at once , or -- '' and he pointed to the executioner ."
712,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` The word of a king of Pantouflia is sacred . ''
713,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` And so is that of a crown prince , '' answered Prigio ; `` and mine is pledged to a lady . ''"
714,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` She shall be a mourning bride , '' cried the king savagely , `` unless '' -- here he paused for a moment -- `` unless you bring me back Alphonso and Enrico , safe and well ! ''"
715,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,The prince thought for the space of a flash of lightning .
716,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` I accept the alternative , '' he said , `` if your majesty will grant me my conditions . ''"
717,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Name them ! '' said the king .
718,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Let me be transported to Gluckstein , left there unguarded , and if , in three days , I do not return with my brothers safe and well , your majesty shall be spared a cruel duty ."
719,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Prigio of Pantouflia will perish by his own hand . ''
720,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The king , whose mind did not work very quickly , took some minutes to think over it ."
721,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he saw that by granting the prince 's conditions , he would either recover his dear sons , or , at least , get rid of Prigio , without the unpleasantness of having him executed ."
722,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"For , though some kings have put their eldest sons to death , and most have wished to do so , they have never been better loved by the people for their Roman virtue ."
723,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Honour bright ? '' said the king at last .
724,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Honour bright ! '' answered the prince , and , for the first time in many months , the royal father and son shook hands ."
725,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` For you , madam , '' said Prigio in a stately way to Lady Molinda , `` in less than a week I trust we shall be taking our vows at the same altar , and that the close of the ceremony which finds us cousins will leave us brother and sister . ''"
726,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Poor Molinda merely stared ; for she could not imagine what he meant .
727,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"In a moment he was gone ; and having taken , by the king 's permission , the flying carpet , he was back at the ambassador 's house in Gluckstein ."
728,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Who was glad to see the prince , if it was not Lady Rosalind ?"
729,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The white roses of her cheeks turned to red roses in a moment , and then back to white again , they were so alarmed at the change ."
730,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"So the two went into the gardens together , and talked about a number of things ; but at last the prince told her that , before three days were over , all would be well , or all would be over with him ."
731,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"For either he would have brought his brothers back , sound and well , to Falkenstein , or he would not survive his dishonour ."
732,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` It is no more than right , '' he said ; `` for had I gone first , neither of them would have been sent to meet the monster after I had fallen ."
733,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And I should have fallen , dear Rosalind , if I had faced the Firedrake before I knew you . ''"
734,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then when she asked him why , and what good she had done him , he told her all the story ; and how , before he fell in love with her , he did n't believe in fairies , or Firedrakes , or caps of darkness , or anything nice and impossible , but only in horrid useless facts , and chemistry , and geology , and arithmetic , and mathematics , and even political economy ."
735,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And the Firedrake would have made a mouthful of him , then ."
736,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"So she was delighted when she heard this , almost as much delighted as she was afraid that he might fail in the most difficult adventure ."
737,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"For it was one thing to egg on a Remora to kill a Firedrake , and quite another to find the princes if they were alive , and restore them if they were dead !"
738,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the prince said he had his plan , and he stayed that night at the ambassador 's ."
739,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Next morning he rose very early , before anyone else was up , that he might not have to say `` Good-bye '' to Lady Rosalind ."
740,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he flew in a moment to the old lonely castle , where nobody went for fear of ghosts , ever since the Court retired to Falkenstein ."
741,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"How still it was , how deserted ; not a sign of life , and yet the prince was looking everywhere for some living thing ."
742,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He hunted the castle through in vain , and then went out to the stable-yard ; but all the dogs , of course , had been taken away , and the farmers had offered homes to the poultry ."
743,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"At last , stretched at full length in a sunny place , the prince found a very old , half-blind , miserable cat ."
744,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The poor creature was lean , and its fur had fallen off in patches ; it could no longer catch birds , nor even mice , and there was nobody to give it milk ."
745,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But cats do not look far into the future ; and this old black cat -- Frank was his name -- had got a breakfast somehow , and was happy in the sun ."
746,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince stood and looked at him pityingly , and he thought that even a sick old cat was , in some ways , happier than most men ."
747,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Well , '' said the prince at last , `` he could not live long anyway , and it must be done ."
748,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,He will feel nothing . ''
749,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he drew the sword of sharpness , and with one turn of his wrist cut the cat 's head clean off ."
750,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"It did not at once change into a beautiful young lady , as perhaps you expect ; no , that was improbable , and , as the prince was in love already , would have been vastly inconvenient ."
751,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The dead cat lay there , like any common cat ."
752,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then the prince built up a heap of straw , with wood on it , and there he laid poor puss , and set fire to the pile ."
753,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Very soon there was nothing of old black Frank left but ashes !
754,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then the prince ran upstairs to the fairy cupboard , his heart beating loudly with excitement ."
755,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The sun was shining through the arrow-shot window , all the yellow motes were dancing in its rays ."
756,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,The light fell on the strange heaps of fairy things -- talismans and spells .
757,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince hunted about here and there , and at last he discovered six ancient water - vessels of black leather , each with a silver plate on it , and on the plate letters engraved ."
758,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,This was what was written on the plates : AQVA .
759,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` Thank heaven ! '' said the prince .
760,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,`` I thought they were sure to have brought it ! ''
761,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he took one of the old black-leather bottles , and ran downstairs again to the place where he had burned the body of the poor old sick cat ."
762,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He opened the bottle , and poured a few drops of the water on the ashes and the dying embers ."
763,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Up there sprang a tall , white flame of fire , waving like a tongue of light ; and forth from the heap jumped the most beautiful , strong , funny , black cat that ever was seen !"
764,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"It was Frank as he had been in the vigour of his youth ; and he knew the prince at once , and rubbed himself against him and purred ."
765,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince lifted up Frank and kissed his nose for joy ; and a bright tear rolled down on Frank 's face , and made him rub his nose with his paw in the most comical manner ."
766,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then the prince set him down , and he ran round and round after his tail ; and , lastly , cocked his tail up , and marched proudly after the prince into the castle ."
767,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Oh , Frank ! '' said Prince Prigio , `` no cat since the time of Puss in Boots was ever so well taken care of as you shall be ."
768,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"For , if the fairy water from the Fountain of Lions can bring you back to life -- why , there is a chance for Alphonso and Enrico ! ''"
769,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then Prigio bustled about , got ready some cold luncheon from the store - room , took all his fairy things that he was likely to need , sat down with them on the flying carpet , and wished himself at the mountain of the Firedrake ."
770,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` I have the king now , '' he said ; `` for if I ca n't find the ashes of my brothers , by Jove !"
771,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"I 'll ! -- '' Do you know what he meant to do , if he could not find his brothers ?"
772,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Let every child guess !
773,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Off he flew ; and there he was in a second , just beside poor Alphono 's garden-engine ."
774,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then Prigio , seeing a little heap of grey ashes beside the engine , watered them with the fairy water ; and up jumped Alphonso , as jolly as ever , his sword in his hand ."
775,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Hullo , Prigio ! '' cried he ; `` are you come after the monster too ?"
776,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"I 've been asleep , and I had a kind of dream that he beat me ."
777,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,But the pair of us will tackle him .
778,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,How is Molinda ? ''
779,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Prettier than ever , '' said Prigio ; `` but anxious about you ."
780,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"However , the Firedrake 's dead and done for ; so never mind him ."
781,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,But I left Enrico somewhere about .
782,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Just you sit down and wait a minute , till I fetch him . ''"
783,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince said this , because he did not wish Alphonso to know that he and Enrico had not had quite the best of it in the affair with the monster ."
784,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` All right , old fellow , '' says Alphonso ; `` but have you any luncheon with you ?"
785,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Never was so hungry in my life ! ''
786,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Prince Prigio had thought of this , and he brought out some cold sausage to which Alphonso was partial and some bread , with which the younger prince expressed himself satisfied ."
787,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then Prigio went up the hill some way , first warning Alphonso not to sit on his carpet for fear of accidents like that which happened to Benson ."
788,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"In a hollow of the hill , sure enough there was the sword of Enrico , the diamonds of the hilt gleaming in the sun ."
789,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,And there was a little heap of grey ashes .
790,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince poured a few drops of the water from the Fountain of Lions on them , and up , of course , jumped Enrico , just as Alphonso had done ."
791,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Sleepy old chap you are , Enrico , '' said the prince ; `` but come on , Alphonso will have finished the grub unless we look smart . ''"
792,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"So back they came , in time to get their share of what was going ; and they drank the Remora 's very good health , when Prigio told them about the fight ."
793,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But neither of them ever knew that they had been dead and done for ; because Prigio invented a story that the mountain was enchanted , and that , as long as the Firedrake lived , everyone who came there fell asleep ."
794,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"He did tell them about the flying carpet , however , which of course did not much surprise them , because they had read all about it in the Arabian Nights and other historical works ."
795,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` And now I 'll show you fun ! '' said Prigio ; and he asked them both to take their seats on the carpet , and wished to be in the valley of the Remora ."
796,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"There they were in a moment , among the old knights whom , if you remember , the Remora had frozen into stone ."
797,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"There was quite a troop of them , in all sorts of armour -- Greek and Roman , and Knight Templars like Front de Boeuf and Brian du Bois Gilbert -- all the brave warriors that had tried to fight the Remora since the world began ."
798,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then Prigio gave each of his brothers some of the water in their caps , and told them to go round pouring a drop or two on each frozen knight ."
799,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And as they did it , lo and behold ! each knight came alive , with his horse , and lifted his sword and shouted : `` Long live Prince Prigio ! '' in Greek , Latin , Egyptian , French , German , and Spanish , -- all of which the prince perfectly understood , and spoke like a native ."
800,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"So he marshalled them in order , and sent them off to ride to Falkenstein and cry : `` Prince Prigio is coming ! ''"
801,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Off they went , the horses ' hoofs clattering , banners flying , sunshine glittering on the spear-points ."
802,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Off they rode to Falkenstein ; and when the king saw them come galloping in , I can tell you he had no more notion of hanging Prigio ."
803,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The princes returned to Gluckstein on the carpet , and went to the best inn , where they dined together and slept ."
804,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Next morning they , and the ambassador , who had been told all the story , and Lady Rosalind , floated comfortably on the carpet back to Falkenstein , where the king wept like anything on the shoulders of Alphonso and Enrico ."
805,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"They could not make out why he cried so , nor why Lady Molinda and Lady Kathleena cried ; but soon they were all laughing and happy again ."
806,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But then -- would you believe he could be so mean ? -- he refused to keep his royal promise , and restore Prigio to his crown-princeship !"
807,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Kings are like that .
808,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But Prigio , very quietly asking for the head of the Firedrake , said he 'd pour the magic water on that , and bring the Firedrake back to life again , unless his majesty behaved rightly ."
809,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"This threat properly frightened King Grognio , and he apologised ."
810,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then the king shook hands with Prigio in public , and thanked him , and said he was proud of him ."
811,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"As to Lady Rosalind , the old gentleman quite fell in love with her , and he sent at once to the Chaplain Royal to get into his surplice , and marry all the young people off at once , without waiting for wedding-cakes , and milliners , and all the rest of it ."
812,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Now , just as they were forming a procession to march into church , who should appear but the queen !"
813,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Her majesty had been travelling by post all the time , and , luckily , had heard of none of the doings since Prigio , Benson , and the king left Gluckstein ."
814,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"I say luckily because if she had heard of them , she would not have believed a word of them ."
815,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But when she saw Alphonso and Enrico , she was much pleased , and said : `` Naughty boys !"
816,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Where have you been hiding ?
817,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,The king had some absurd story about your having been killed by a fabulous monster .
818,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Bah ! don't tell me .
819,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"I always said you would come back after a little trip -- did n't I , Prigio ? ''"
820,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Certainly , madam , '' said Prigio ; `` and I said so , too ."
821,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Did n't I say so ? ''
822,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"And all the courtiers cried : `` Yes , you did ; '' but some added , to themselves , '' He always says , ` Did n't I say so ? ' ''"
823,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then the queen was introduced to Lady Rosalind , and she said it was `` rather a short engagement , but she supposed young people understood their own affairs best . ''"
824,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,And they do !
825,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"So the three pairs were married , with the utmost rejoicings ; and her majesty never , her whole life long , could be got to believe that anything unusual had occurred ."
826,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The honeymoon of Prince Prigio and the Crown Princess Rosalind was passed at the castle , where the prince had been deserted by the Court ."
827,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But now it was delightfully fitted up ; and Master Frank marched about the house with his tail in the air , as if the place belonged to him ."
828,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Now , on the second day of their honeymoon , the prince and princess were sitting in the garden together , and the prince said , `` Are you quite happy , my dear ? '' and Rosalind said , `` Yes ; quite . ''"
829,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But the prince did not like the tone of her voice , and he said : `` No , there 's something ; do tell me what it is . ''"
830,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` Well , '' said Rosalind , putting her head on his shoulder , and speaking very low , `` I want everybody to love you as much as I do ."
831,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"No , not quite so very much , -- but I want them to like you ."
832,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Now they ca n't , because they are afraid of you ; for you are so awfully clever ."
833,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Now , could n't you take the wishing cap , and wish to be no cleverer than other people ?"
834,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Then everybody would like you ! ''
835,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"The prince thought a minute , then he said : `` Your will is law , my dear ; anything to please you ."
836,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Just wait a minute ! ''
837,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he ran upstairs , for the last time , to the fairy garret , and he put on the wishing cap ."
838,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"`` No , '' thought he to himself , `` I wo n't wish that ."
839,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Every man has one secret from his wife , and this shall be mine . ''"
840,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,Then he said aloud : `` I WISH TO SEEM NO CLEVERER THAN OTHER PEOPLE . ''
841,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"Then he ran downstairs again , and the princess noticed a great difference in him though , of course , there was really none at all , and so did everyone ."
842,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"For the prince remained as clever as ever he had been ; but , as nobody observed it , he became the most popular prince , and finally the best-beloved king who had ever sat on the throne of Pantouflia ."
843,Andrew Lang,Prince Prigio,1889,"But occasionally Rosalind would say , `` I do believe , my dear , that you are really as clever as ever ! ''"
844,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` I 'm sure I don't know what to do with that boy ! '' said King Prigio of Pantouflia .
845,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` If you don't know , my dear , '' said Queen Rosalind , his illustrious consort , `` I can't see what is to be done . You are so clever . ''"
846,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The king and queen were sitting in the royal library , of which the shelves were full of the most delightful fairy books in all languages , all equally familiar to King Prigio ."
847,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The queen could not read most of them herself , but the king used to read them aloud to her ."
848,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"A good many years had passed -- seventeen , in fact -- since Queen Rosalind was married , but you would not think it to look at her ."
849,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Her grey eyes were as kind and soft and beautiful , her dark hair as dark , and her pretty colour as like a white rose blushing , as on the day when she was a bride ."
850,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And she was as fond of the king as when he was only Prince Prigio , and he was as fond of her as on the night when he first met her at the ball ."
851,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` No , I don't know what to do with Dick , '' said the king ."
852,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He meant his son , Prince Ricardo , but he called him Dick in private ."
853,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I believe it 's the fault of his education , '' his Majesty went on ."
854,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` We have not brought him up rightly .
855,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"These fairy books are at the bottom of his provoking behaviour , '' and he glanced round the shelves ."
856,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Now , when I was a boy , my dear mother tried to prevent me from reading fairy books , because she did not believe in fairies . ''"
857,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` But she was wrong , you know , '' said the queen ."
858,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Why , if it had not been for all these fairy presents , the Cap of Darkness and all the rest of them , you never could have killed the Fire-beast and the Ice-beast , and -- you never could have married me , '' the queen added , in a happy whisper , blushing beautifully , for that was a foolish habit of hers ."
859,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` It is quite true , '' said the king , `` and therefore I thought it best to bring Dick up on fairy books , that he might know what is right , and have no nonsense about him ."
860,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But perhaps the thing has been overdone ; at all events , it is not a success ."
861,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I wonder if fathers and sons will ever understand each other , and get on well together ?"
862,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"There was my poor father , King Grognio , he wanted me to take to adventures , like other princes , fighting Firedrakes , and so forth ; and I did not care for it , till you set me on , '' and he looked very kindly at her Majesty ."
863,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` And now , here 's Dick , '' the monarch continued , `` I ca n't hold him back ."
864,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He is always after a giant , or a dragon , or a magician , as the case may be ; he will certainly be ploughed for his examination at College ."
865,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Never opens a book .
866,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"What does he care , off after every adventure he can hear about ?"
867,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"An idle , restless youth !"
868,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Ah , my poor country , when I am gone , what may not be your misfortunes under Ricardo ! ''"
869,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Here his Majesty sighed , and seemed plunged in thought ."
870,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` But you are not going yet , my dear , '' said the queen ."
871,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Why you are not forty !
872,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,And young people will be young people .
873,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"You were quite proud when poor Dick came home with his first brace of gigantic fierce birds , killed off his own sword , and with such a pretty princess he had rescued -- dear Jaqueline ?"
874,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I 'm sure she is like a daughter to me .
875,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I can not do without her . ''
876,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I wish she were a daughter-in-law ; I wish Dick would take a fancy to marry her , '' said the king ."
877,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` A nicer girl I never saw . ''
878,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` And so accomplished , '' added Queen Rosalind ."
879,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` That girl can turn herself into anything -- a mouse , a fly , a lion , a wheelbarrow , a church !"
880,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I never knew such talent for magic .
881,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Of course she had the best of teachers , the Fairy Paribanou herself ; but very few girls , in our time , devote so many hours to practice as dear Jaqueline ."
882,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Even now , when she is out of the schoolroom , she still practises her scales ."
883,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I saw her turning little Dollie into a fish and back again in the bath-room last night .
884,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The child was delighted . ''
885,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"In these times , you must know , princesses learned magic , just as they learn the piano nowadays ; but they had their music lessons too , dancing , calisthenics , and the use of the globes ."
886,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Yes , she 's a dear , good girl , '' said the king ; `` yet she looks melancholy ."
887,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I believe , myself , that if Ricardo asked her to marry him , she would not say ` No . '"
888,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But that 's just one of the things I object to most in Dick .
889,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Round the world he goes , rescuing ladies from every kind of horror -- from dragons , giants , cannibals , magicians ; and then , when a girl naturally expects to be married to him , as is usual , off he rides !"
890,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,He has no more heart than a flounder .
891,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Why , at his age I -- '' `` At his age , my dear , you were so hard-hearted that you were quite a proverb ."
892,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Why , I have been told that you used to ask girls dreadful puzzling questions , like ` Who was Caesar Borgia ? '"
893,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,` What do you know of Edwin and Morcar ? ' and so on . ''
894,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I had not seen you then , '' said the king ."
895,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` And Ricardo has not seen her , whoever she may be ."
896,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Besides , he ca n't possibly marry all of them ."
897,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And I think a girl should consider herself lucky if she is saved from a dragon or a giant , without expecting to be married next day . ''"
898,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Perhaps ; but it is usual , '' said the king , `` and their families expect it , and keep sending ambassadors to know what Dick 's intentions are ."
899,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I would not mind it all so very much if he killed the monsters off his own sword , as he did that first brace , in fair fight ."
900,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But ever since he found his way into that closet where the fairy presents lie , everything has been made too easy for him ."
901,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"It is a royal road to glory , or giant-slaying made easy ."
902,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,In his Cap of Darkness a poor brute of a dragon ca n't see him .
903,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,In his Shoes of Swiftness the giants ca n't catch him .
904,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,His Sword of Sharpness would cut any oak asunder at a blow ! ''
905,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` But you were very glad of them when you made the Ice-beast and the Fire - beast fight and kill each other , '' said the queen ."
906,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Yes , my dear ; but it wanted some wit , if I may say so , to do that , and Dick just goes at it hammer and tongs : anybody could do it ."
907,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,It 's intellect I miss in Ricardo .
908,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,How am I to know whether he could make a good fight for it without all these fairy things ?
909,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I wonder what the young rogue is about to-day ?
910,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He 'll be late for dinner , as usual , I daresay ."
911,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I ca n't stand want of punctuality at meals , '' remarked his Majesty , which is a sign that he was growing old after all ; for where is the fun of being expected always to come home in time for dinner when , perhaps , you are fishing , and the trout are rising splendidly ?"
912,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Young people will be young people , '' said the queen ."
913,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` If you are anxious about him , why don't you look for him in the magic crystal ? ''"
914,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Now the magic crystal was a fairy present , a great ball of glass in which , if you looked , you saw the person you wanted to see , and what he was doing , however far away he might be , if he was on the earth at all ."
915,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I 'll just take a look at it , '' said the king ; `` it only wants three-quarters of an hour to dinner-time . ''"
916,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"His Majesty rose , and walked to the crystal globe , which was in a stand , like other globes ."
917,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He stared into it , he turned it round and round , and Queen Rosalind saw him grow quite pale as he gazed ."
918,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I don't see him anywhere , '' said the king , `` and I have looked everywhere ."
919,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I do hope nothing has happened to the boy .
920,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,He is so careless .
921,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"If he dropped his Cap of Darkness in a fight with a giant , why who knows what might occur ? ''"
922,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh , ` Gio , how you frighten me ! '' said the queen ."
923,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,King Prigio was still turning the crystal globe .
924,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Stop ! '' he cried ; `` I see a beautiful princess , fastened by iron chains to a rock beside the sea , in a lonely place ."
925,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"They must have fixed her up as a sacrifice to a sea-monster , like what 's - her-name . ''"
926,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"This proves how anxious he was , or , being so clever and learned , he would have remembered that her name was Andromeda ."
927,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I bet Dick is not far off , where there is an adventure on hand ."
928,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But where on earth can he be ?
929,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"... My word ! '' suddenly exclaimed the monarch , in obvious excitement ."
930,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` What is it , dear ? '' cried the queen , with all the anxiety of a mother ."
931,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Why , the sea where the girl is , has turned all red as blood ! '' exclaimed the king ."
932,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Now it is all being churned up by the tail of a tremendous monster .
933,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,He is a whopper !
934,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,He 's coming on shore ; the girl is fainting .
935,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,He 's out on shore !
936,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He is extremely poorly , blood rushing from his open jaws ."
937,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,He 's dying !
938,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And , hooray ! here 's Dick coming out of his enormous mouth , all in armour set with sharp spikes , and a sword in his hand ."
939,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He 's covered with blood , but he 's well and hearty ."
940,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He must have been swallowed by the brute , and cut him up inside ."
941,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Now he 's cutting the beast 's head off .
942,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Now he 's gone to the princess ; a very neat bow he has made her .
943,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Dick 's manners are positively improving !
944,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Now he 's cutting her iron chains off with the Sword of Sharpness .
945,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And now he 's made her another bow , and he 's actually taking leave of her ."
946,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Poor thing !
947,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,How disappointed she is looking .
948,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And she 's so pretty , too ."
949,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I say , Rosalind , shall I shout to him through the magic horn , and tell him to bring her home here , on the magic carpet ? ''"
950,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I think not , dear ; the palace is quite full , '' said the queen ."
951,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But the real reason was that she wanted Ricardo to marry her favourite Princess Jaqueline , and she did not wish the new princess to come in the way ."
952,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` As you like , '' said the king , who knew what was in her mind very well ."
953,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Besides , I see her own people coming for her ."
954,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I 'm sorry for her , but it ca n't be helped , and Dick is half-way home by now on the Shoes of Swiftness ."
955,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I daresay he will not keep dinner waiting after all .
956,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But what a fright the boy has given me ! ''
957,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,At this moment a whirring in the air and a joyous shout were heard .
958,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,It was Prince Ricardo flying home on his Seven-league Boots .
959,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Hi , Ross ! '' he shouted , `` just weigh this beast 's head ."
960,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I 've had a splendid day with a sea-monster .
961,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Get the head stuffed , will you ?"
962,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,We 'll have it set up in the billiard-room . ''
963,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Yes , Master Dick -- I mean your Royal Highness , '' said Ross , a Highland keeper , who had not previously been employed by a Reigning Family ."
964,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` It 's a fine head , whatever , '' he added , meditatively ."
965,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Prince Ricardo now came beneath the library window , and gave his parents a brief account of his adventure ."
966,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I picked the monster up early in the morning , '' he said , `` through the magic telescope , father . ''"
967,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` What country was he in ? '' said the king .
968,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` The country people whom I met called it Ethiopia .
969,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,They were niggers . ''
970,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` And in what part of the globe is Ethiopia , Ricardo ? ''"
971,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Oh !
972,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I don't know .
973,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Asia , perhaps , '' answered the prince ."
974,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The king groaned .
975,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` That boy will never understand our foreign relations .
976,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Ethiopia in Asia ! '' he said to himself , but he did not choose to make any remark at the moment ."
977,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The prince ran upstairs to dress .
978,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,On the stairs he met the Princess Jaqueline .
979,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh , Dick ! are you hurt ? '' she said , turning very pale ."
980,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` No , not I ; but the monster is ."
981,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I had a capital day , Jack ; rescued a princess , too . ''"
982,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Was she -- was she very pretty , Dick ? ''"
983,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Oh !
984,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I don't know .
985,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Pretty enough , I daresay ."
986,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Much like other girls .
987,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Why , you look quite white !"
988,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,What 's the matter ?
989,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Now you look all right again ; '' for , indeed , the Princess Jaqueline was blushing ."
990,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` I must dress .
991,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I 'm ever so late , '' he said , hurrying upstairs ; and the princess , with a little sigh , went down to the royal drawing-room ."
992,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"When dinner was over and the ladies had left the room , the king tried to speak seriously to Prince Ricardo ."
993,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,This was a thing which he disliked doing very much .
994,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` There 's very little use in preaching , '' his Majesty used to say , `` to a man , or rather a boy , of another generation ."
995,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,My taste was for books ; I only took to adventures because I was obliged to do it .
996,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Dick 's taste is for adventures ; I only wish some accident would make him take to books .
997,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But everyone must get his experience for himself ; and when he has got it , he is lucky if it is not too late ."
998,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I wish I could see him in love with some nice girl , who would keep him at home . ''"
999,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The king did not expect much from talking seriously to Dick .
1000,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"However , he began by asking questions about the day 's sport , which Ricardo answered with modesty ."
1001,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then his Majesty observed that , from all he had ever read or heard , he believed Ethiopia , where the fight was , to be in Africa , not in Asia ."
1002,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I really wish , Ricardo , that you would attend to your geography a little more ."
1003,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"It is most necessary to a soldier that he should know where his enemy is , and if he has to fight the Dutch , for instance , not to start with his army for Central Asia . ''"
1004,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I could always spot them through the magic glass , father , '' said Dick ; `` it saves such a lot of trouble ."
1005,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I hate geography . ''
1006,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` But the glass might be lost or broken , or the Fairies might take it away , and then where are you ? ''"
1007,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh , you would know where to go , or Mr. Belsham . ''"
1008,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Now Mr. Belsham was his tutor , from Oxford ."
1009,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` But I shall not always be here , and when I die -- '' `` Do n't talk of dying , sire , '' said Dick ."
1010,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Why , you are not so very old ; you may live for years yet ."
1011,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Besides , I ca n't stand the notion ."
1012,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,You must live for ever ! ''
1013,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` That sentiment is unusual in a Crown Prince , '' thought the king ; but he was pleased for all that ."
1014,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Well , to oblige you , I 'll try to struggle against old age , '' he said ; `` but there are always accidents ."
1015,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Now , Dick , like a good fellow , and to please me , work hard all to-morrow till the afternoon ."
1016,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I 'll come in and help you .
1017,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And there 's always a splendid evening rise of trout in the lake just now , so you can have your play after your work ."
1018,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"You 'll enjoy it more , and I daresay you are tired after a long day with the big game ."
1019,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"It used to tire me , I remember . ''"
1020,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I am rather tired , '' said Dick ; and indeed he looked a little pale , for a day in the inside of a gigantic sea-monster is fatiguing , from the heat and want of fresh air which are usually found in such places ."
1021,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I think I 'll turn in ; goodnight , my dear old governor , '' he said , in an affectionate manner , though he was not usually given to many words ."
1022,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then he went and kissed his mother and the Princess Jaqueline , whom he engaged to row him on the lake next evening , while he fished ."
1023,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` And don't you go muffing them with the landing-net , Jack , as you generally do , '' said his Royal Highness , as he lit his bedroom candle ."
1024,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I wish he would not call me Jack , '' said the princess to the queen ."
1025,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` It 's better than Lina , my dear , '' said her Majesty , who in late life had become fond of her little joke ; `` that always sounds as if someone else was fatter , -- and I hope there is not someone else . ''"
1026,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The princess was silent , and fixed her eyes on her book ."
1027,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Presently the king came in , and played a game with Lina at picquet ."
1028,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"When they were all going to bed , he said : `` Just come into the study , Lina ."
1029,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I want you to write a few letters for me . ''
1030,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The princess followed him and took her seat at the writing table .
1031,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The letters were very short .
1032,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"One was to Herr Schnipp , tailor to the king and royal family ; another was to the royal swordmaker , another to the bootmaker , another to the optician , another to the tradesman who supplied the august family with carpets and rugs , another to his Majesty 's hatter ."
1033,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,They were all summoned to be at the palace early next morning .
1034,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then his Majesty yawned , apologised , and went to bed ."
1035,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The princess also went to her room , or bower as it was then called , but not to sleep ."
1036,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She was unhappy that Dick did not satisfy his father , and that he was so careless , and also about other things ."
1037,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` And why does the king want all these tailors and hatters so suddenly , telescope-makers and swordmakers and shoemakers , too ? '' she asked herself , as she stood at the window watching the moon ."
1038,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` I could find out .
1039,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I could turn myself into a dog or a cat , and go into the room where he is giving his orders ."
1040,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But that is awkward , for when the servants see Rip '' that was the dog `` in two places at once , they begin to think the palace is haunted , and it makes people talk ."
1041,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Besides , I know it is wrong to listen to what one is not meant to hear ."
1042,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,It is often difficult to be a magician and a good girl .
1043,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The temptations are so strong , stronger than most people allow for . ''"
1044,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"So she remained , with the moon shining on her pretty yellow hair and her white dress , wondering what the king intended to do , and whether it was something that Dick would not like ."
1045,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` How stupid of me , '' she said at length , `` after all the lessons I have had ."
1046,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Why , I can drink the moon ! ''"
1047,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Now , this is a way of knowing what anyone else is thinking of and intends to do , for the moon sees and knows everything ."
1048,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Whether it is quite fair is another matter ; but , at all events , it is not listening ."
1049,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And anyone may see that , if you are a magician , like the Princess Jaqueline , a great many difficult questions as to what is right and wrong at once occur which do not trouble other people ."
1050,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"King Prigio 's secret , why he sent for the tailor and the other people , was his own secret ."
1051,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The princess decided that she would not find it out by turning herself into Rip or the cat whose name was Semiramis , and , so far , she was quite right ."
1052,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But she was very young , and it never occurred to her that it was just as wrong to find out what the king meant by drinking the moon as by listening in disguise ."
1053,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"As she grew older she learned to know better ; but this is just the danger of teaching young girls magic , and for that very reason it has been given up in most countries ."
1054,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"However , the princess did not think about right and wrong , unluckily ."
1055,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She went to the bookcase and took down her Cornelius Agrippa , in one great tall black volume , with silver clasps which nobody else could open ; for , as the princess said , there are books which it would never do to leave lying about where the servants or anybody could read them ."
1056,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Nobody could undo the clasps , however strong or clever he might be ; but the princess just breathed on them and made a sign , and the book flew open at the right place -- Book IV. , chapter vi. , about the middle of page 576 ."
1057,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The magic spell was in Latin , of course ; but the princess knew Latin very well , and soon she had the magic song by heart ."
1058,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Then she closed the book and put it back on the shelf .
1059,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then she threw open the window and drew back the curtains , and put out all the lights except two scented candles that burned with a white fire under a round mirror with a silver frame , opposite the window ."
1060,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And into that mirror the moon shone white and full , filling all the space of it , so that the room was steeped in a strange silver light ."
1061,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Now the whole room seemed to sway gently , waving and trembling ; and as it trembled it sounded and rang with a low silver music , as if it were filled with the waves of the sea ."
1062,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then the princess took a great silver basin , covered with strange black signs and figures raised in the silver ."
1063,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She poured water into the basin , and as she poured it she sang the magic spell from the Latin book ."
1064,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"It was something like this , in English : `` Oh Lady Moon , on the waters riding , On shining waters , in silver sheen , Show me the secret the heart is hiding , Show me the truth of the thought , oh Queen !"
1065,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh waters white , where the moon is riding , That knows what shall be and what has been , Tell me the secret the heart is hiding , Wash me the truth of it , clear and clean ! ''"
1066,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"As she sang the water in the silver basin foamed and bubbled , and then fell still again ; and the princess knelt in the middle of the room , and the moon and the white light from the mirror of the moon fell in the water ."
1067,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then the princess raised the basin , and stooped her mouth to it and drank the water , spilling a few drops , and so she drank the moon and the knowledge of the moon ."
1068,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then the moon was darkened without a cloud , and there was darkness in the sky for a time , and all the dogs in the world began to howl ."
1069,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"When the moon shone again , the princess rose and put out the two white lights , and drew the curtains ; and presently she went to bed ."
1070,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Now I know all about it , '' she said ."
1071,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` It is clever ; everything the king does is clever , and he is so kind that I daresay he does not mean any harm ."
1072,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But it seems a cruel trick to play on poor Ricardo .
1073,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"However , Jaqueline is on the watch , and I 'll show them a girl can do more than people think , '' -- as , indeed , she could ."
1074,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"After meditating in this way , the princess fell sleep , and did not waken till her maid came to call her ."
1075,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh ! your Royal Highness , what 's this on the floor ? '' said the faithful Rosina , as she was arranging the princess 's things for her to get up ."
1076,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Why , what is it ? '' asked the princess ."
1077,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Ever so many -- four , five , six , seven -- little shining drops of silver lying on the carpet , as if they had melted and fallen there ! ''"
1078,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` They have not hurt the carpet ? '' said the princess .
1079,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Oh dear ! the queen wo n't be pleased at all .
1080,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,It was a little chemical experiment I was trying last night . ''
1081,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But she knew very well that she must have dropped seven drops of the enchanted water .
1082,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` No , your Royal Highness , the carpet is not harmed , '' said Rosina ; `` only your Royal Highness should do these things in the laboratory ."
1083,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Her Majesty has often spoke about it . ''
1084,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` You are quite right , '' said the princess ; `` but as there is no harm done , we 'll say nothing about it this time ."
1085,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And , Rosina , you may keep the silver drops for yourself . ''"
1086,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Your Royal Highness is always very kind , '' said Rosina , which was true ; but how much better and wiser it is not to begin to deceive !"
1087,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"We never know how far we may be carried , and so Jaqueline found out ."
1088,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"For when she went down to breakfast , there was the king in a great state of excitement , for him ."
1089,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` It 's most extraordinary , '' said his Majesty ."
1090,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` What is ? '' asked the queen .
1091,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Why , did n't you notice it ?"
1092,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"No , you had gone to bed before it happened ."
1093,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But I was taking a walk in the moonlight , on the balcony , and I observed it carefully . ''"
1094,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Observed what , my dear ? '' asked the queen , who was pouring out the tea ."
1095,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Did n't you see it , Dick ?"
1096,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Late as usual , you young dog ! '' the king remarked as Ricardo entered the room ."
1097,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` See what , sir ? '' said Dick ."
1098,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh , you were asleep hours before , now I think of it !"
1099,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But it was the most extraordinary thing , an unpredicted eclipse of the moon !"
1100,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"You must have noticed it , Jaqueline ; you sat up later ."
1101,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,How the dogs howled ! ''
1102,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` No ; I mean yes , '' murmured poor Jaqueline , who of course had caused the whole affair by her magic arts , but who had forgotten , in the excitement of the moment , that an eclipse of the moon , especially if entirely unexpected , is likely to attract very general attention ."
1103,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Jaqueline could not bear to tell a fib , especially to a king who had been so kind to her ; besides , fibbing would not alter the facts ."
1104,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Yes , I did see it , '' she admitted , blushing ."
1105,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Had it not been predicted ? ''
1106,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Not a word about it whispered anywhere , '' said his Majesty ."
1107,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` I looked up the almanack at once .
1108,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"It is the most extraordinary thing I ever saw , and I 've seen a good many . ''"
1109,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` The astronomers must be duffers , '' said Prince Ricardo ."
1110,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` I never thought there was much in physical science of any sort ; most dreary stuff .
1111,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Why , they say the earth goes round the sun , whereas any fool can see it is just the other way on . ''"
1112,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"King Prigio was struck aghast by these sentiments in the mouth of his son and heir , the hope of Pantouflia ."
1113,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But what was the king to say in reply ?
1114,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The astronomers of Pantouflia , who conceived that they knew a great deal , had certainly been taken by surprise this time ."
1115,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Indeed , they have not yet satisfactorily explained this eclipse of the moon , though they have written volumes about it ."
1116,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Why , it may be the sun next ! '' exclaimed his Majesty ."
1117,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Anything may happen .
1118,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The very laws of gravitation themselves may go askew ! ''
1119,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"At this moment the butler , William , who had been in the queen 's family when she was a girl , entered , and announced : `` Some of the royal tradesmen , by appointment , to see your Majesty . ''"
1120,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"So the king , who had scarcely eaten any breakfast , much to the annoyance of the queen , who was not agitated by eclipses , went out and joined the tailors and the rest of them ."
1121,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Dick went on with his breakfast .
1122,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He ate cold pastry , and poached eggs , and ham , and rolls , and raspberry jam , and hot cakes ; and he drank two cups of coffee ."
1123,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Meanwhile the king had joined the tradesmen who attended by his orders .
1124,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"They were all met in the royal study , where the king made them a most splendid bow , and requested them to be seated ."
1125,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But they declined to sit in his sacred presence , and the king observed that , in that case he must stand up ."
1126,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I have invited you here , gentlemen , '' he said , `` on a matter of merely private importance , but I must request that you will be entirely silent as to the nature of your duties ."
1127,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"It is difficult , I know , not to talk about one 's work , but in this instance I am sure you will oblige me . ''"
1128,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Your Majesty has only to command , '' said Herr Schnipp ."
1129,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` There have been monarchs , in neighbouring kingdoms , who would have cut off all our heads after we had done a bit of secret business ; but the merest word of your Majesty is law to your loving subjects . ''"
1130,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The other merchants murmured assent , for King Prigio was really liked by his people ."
1131,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,He was always good-tempered and polite .
1132,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,He never went to war with anybody .
1133,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He spent most of the royal income on public objects , and of course there were scarcely any taxes to speak of ."
1134,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Moreover , he had abolished what is called compulsory education , or making everybody go to school whether he likes it or not ; a most mischievous and tyrannical measure !"
1135,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` A fellow who ca n't teach himself to read , '' said the king , `` is not worth teaching . ''"
1136,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"For all these reasons , and because they were so fond of the queen , his subjects were ready to do anything in reason for King Prigio ."
1137,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Only one tradesman , bowing very deep and blushing very much , said : `` Your Majesty , will you hear me for one moment ? ''"
1138,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` For an hour , with pleasure , Herr Schmidt , '' said the monarch ."
1139,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` It is an untradesman-like and an unusual thing to decline an order ; and if your Majesty asked for my heart 's blood , I am ready to shed it , not to speak of anything in the line of my business -- namely , boot and shoe making ."
1140,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But keep a secret from my wife , I fairly own to your Majesty that I can not . ''"
1141,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Herr Schmidt went down on his knees and wept .
1142,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Rise , Herr Schmidt , '' said the king , taking him by the hand ."
1143,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` A more honourable and chivalrous confession of an amiable weakness , if it is to be called a weakness , I never heard ."
1144,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Sir , you have been true to your honour and your prince , in face of what few men can bear , the chance of ridicule ."
1145,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"There is no one here , I hope , but respects and will keep the secret of Herr Schmidt 's confession ? ''"
1146,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The assembled shopkeepers could scarcely refrain from tears .
1147,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Long live King Prigio the Good ! '' they exclaimed , and vowed that everything should be kept dark ."
1148,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Indeed , sire , '' said the swordmaker , `` all the rest of us are bachelors . ''"
1149,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` That is none the worse for my purpose gentlemen , '' said his Majesty ; `` but I trust that you will not long deprive me of sons and subjects worthy to succeed to such fathers ."
1150,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And now , if Herr Schmidt will kindly find his way to the buttery , where refreshments are ready , I shall have the pleasure of conducting you to the scene of your labours . ''"
1151,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Thus speaking , the king , with another magnificent bow , led the way upstairs to a little turret-room , in a deserted part of the palace ."
1152,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Bidding the tradesmen enter , he showed them a large collection of miscellaneous things : an old cap or two , a pair of boots of a sort long out of fashion , an old broadsword , a shabby old Persian rug , an ivory spy - glass , and other articles ."
1153,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"These were , in fact , the fairy presents , which had been given to the king at his christening , and by aid of which and his natural acuteness he had , in his youth , succeeded in many remarkable adventures ."
1154,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The caps were the Wishing Cap and the Cap of Darkness .
1155,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The rug was the famous carpet which carried its owner through the air wherever he wished to go .
1156,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The sword was the Sword of Sharpness .
1157,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The ivory glass showed you anyone you wanted to see , however far off ."
1158,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The boots were the Seven-league Boots , which Hop-o ' - my-Thumb stole from the Ogre about 1697 ."
1159,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"There were other valuable objects , but these were the most useful and celebrated ."
1160,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Of course the king did not tell the tradesmen what they were .
1161,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Now , gentlemen , '' said his Majesty , `` you see these old things ."
1162,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"For reasons which I must ask you to excuse me for keeping to myself , I wish you to provide me with objects exactly and precisely similar to these , with all the look of age . ''"
1163,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The tradesmen examined the objects , each choosing that in his own line of business ."
1164,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` As to the sword , sire , '' said the cutler , `` it is an Andrea Ferrara , a fine old blade ."
1165,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"By a lucky accident , I happen to have one at home in a small collection of ancient weapons , exactly like it ."
1166,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,This evening it shall be at your Majesty 's disposal . ''
1167,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Perhaps , Herr Schnitzler , you will kindly write an order for it , as I wish no one of you to leave the palace , if you can conveniently stay , till your business is finished . ''"
1168,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` With pleasure , your Majesty , '' says the cutler ."
1169,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` As to the old rug , '' said the upholsterer , `` I have a Persian one quite identical with it at home , at your Majesty 's service . ''"
1170,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Then you can do like Herr Schnitzler , '' who was the cutler ."
1171,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` And I , '' said the hatter , `` have two old caps just like these , part of a bankrupt theatrical stock . ''"
1172,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` We are most fortunate , '' said the king ."
1173,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` The boots , now I come to think of it , are unimportant , at least for the present ."
1174,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Perhaps we can borrow a pair from the theatre . ''
1175,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` As for the glass , '' said the optician , `` if your Majesty will allow me to take it home with me -- '' `` I am afraid I can not part with it , '' said the king ; `` but that , too , is unimportant , or not very pressing . ''"
1176,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then he called for a servant , to order luncheon for the shopkeepers , and paper for them to write their orders on ."
1177,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But no one was within hearing , and in that very old part of the palace there were no bells ."
1178,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Just pardon me for an instant , while I run downstairs , '' said his Majesty ; `` and , it seems a strange thing to ask , but may I advise you not to sit down on that carpet ?"
1179,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I have a reason for it . ''
1180,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"In fact , he was afraid that someone might sit down on it , and wish he was somewhere else , and be carried away , as was the nature of the carpet ."
1181,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"King Prigio was not absent a minute , for he met William on the stairs ; but when he came back , there was not one single person in the turret-room !"
1182,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Where on earth are they ? '' cried the king , rushing through all the rooms in that part of the castle ."
1183,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He shouted for them , and looked everywhere ; but there was not a trace of tailor , hatter , optician , swordmaker , upholsterer ."
1184,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The king hastened to a window over the gate , and saw the sentinels on duty ."
1185,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Hi ! '' he called .
1186,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And the sentinels turned round , looked up , and saluted ."
1187,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Have you seen anyone go out ? '' he cried .
1188,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` No one , sire , '' answered the soldiers ."
1189,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The king , who began to guess what had happened , hurried back to the turret-room ."
1190,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,There were all the tradesmen with parcels under their arms .
1191,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` What means this , gentlemen ? '' said his Majesty , severely ."
1192,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` For what reason did you leave the room without my permission ? ''
1193,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"They all knelt down , humbly imploring his compassion ."
1194,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Get up , you donkeys ! '' said the king , forgetting his politeness ."
1195,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Get up , and tell me where you have been hiding yourselves . ''"
1196,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The hatter came forward , and said : `` Sire , you will not believe me ; indeed , I can scarcely believe it myself ! ''"
1197,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Nor none of us ca n't , '' said the swordmaker ."
1198,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` We have been home , and brought the articles ."
1199,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"All orders executed with punctuality and dispatch , '' he added , quoting his own advertisement without thinking of it ."
1200,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"On this the swordmaker took out and exhibited the Andrea Ferrara blade , which was exactly like the Sword of Sharpness ."
1201,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The upholsterer undid his parcel , and there was a Persian rug , which no one could tell from the magical carpet ."
1202,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The hatter was fumbling with the string of his parcel , when he suddenly remembered , what the king in his astonishment had not noticed , that he had a cap on himself ."
1203,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He pulled it off in a hurry , and the king at once saw that it was his Wishing Cap , and understood all about the affair ."
1204,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The hatter , in his absence , had tried on the Wishing Cap , and had wished that he himself and his friends were all at home and back again with their wares at the palace ."
1205,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And what he wished happened , of course , as was natural ."
1206,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"In a moment the king saw how much talk this business would produce in the country , and he decided on the best way to stop it ."
1207,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Seizing the Wishing Cap , he put it on , wished all the tradesmen , including the shoemaker , back in the town at their shops , and also wished that none of them should remember anything about the whole affair ."
1208,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,In a moment he was alone in the turret-room .
1209,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"As for the shopkeepers , they had a kind of idea that they had dreamed something odd ; but , as it went no further , of course they did not talk about it , and nobody was any the wiser ."
1210,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Owl that I am ! '' said King Prigio to himself .
1211,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` I might have better wished for a complete set of sham fairy things which would not work .
1212,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"It would have saved a great deal of trouble ; but I am so much out of the habit of using the cap , that I never thought of it ."
1213,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"However , what I have got will do very well . ''"
1214,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then , putting on the Cap of Darkness , that nobody might see him , he carried all the real fairy articles away , except the Seven-league Boots , to his own room , where he locked them up , leaving in their place the sham Wishing Cap , the sham Cap of Darkness , the sham Sword of Sharpness , and the carpet which was not a magic carpet at all ."
1215,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"His idea was , of course , that Ricardo would start on an expedition confiding in his fairy things , and he would find that they did not act ."
1216,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Then he would be left to his own cleverness and courage to get him out of the scrape .
1217,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"That would teach him , thought the king , to depend on himself , and to set a proper value on cleverness and learning , and minding his book ."
1218,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Of course he might have locked the things up , and forbidden Ricardo to touch them , but that might have seemed harsh ."
1219,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And , as you may easily imagine , with all the powers at his command , the king fancied he could easily rescue Ricardo from any very serious danger at the hands of giants or magicians or monsters ."
1220,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He only wanted to give him a fright or two , and make him respect the judgment of older and wiser people than himself ."
1221,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"For several days Prince Ricardo minded his books , and , according to his tutors , made considerable progress in polite learning ."
1222,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Perhaps he ought not to be praised too highly for this , because , in fact , he saw no means of distinguishing himself by adventures just at that time ."
1223,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Every morning he would climb the turret and sweep the horizon , and even much beyond the horizon , with the ivory spy-glass ."
1224,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But look as he would , he saw no monsters preying on human-kind anywhere , nor princesses in distress ."
1225,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"To be sure he saw plenty of poor people in distress , and , being a good-hearted , though careless , lad , Dick would occasionally fly off with the Purse of Fortunatus in his pocket , and give them as much money as they needed -- it cost him nothing ."
1226,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But this was not the kind of adventure which he enjoyed .
1227,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Dragons for his money !
1228,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"One day the Princess Jaqueline took a curious plan of showing Ricardo how little interest , after all , there is in performing the most wonderful exploits without any real difficulty or danger ."
1229,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"They were drifting before a light breeze on a hill lake ; Ricardo was fishing , and Jaqueline was sculling a stroke now and then , just to keep the boat right with the wind ."
1230,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Ricardo had very bad sport , when suddenly the trout began to rise all over the lake ."
1231,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Dick got excited , and stumbled about the boat from stern to bow , tripping over Jaqueline 's feet , and nearly upsetting the vessel in his hurry to throw his flies over every trout he saw feeding ."
1232,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But , as too often occurs , they were taking one particular fly which was on the water , and would look at nothing else ."
1233,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh , bother them ! '' cried Ricardo ."
1234,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` I ca n't find a fly in my book in the least like that little black one they are feeding on ! ''
1235,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He tried half-a-dozen different fly-hooks , but all to no purpose ; he lost his temper , got his tackle entangled in Jaqueline 's hair and then in the landing-net ; and , though such a big boy , he was nearly crying with vexation ."
1236,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The Princess Jaqueline , with great pains and patience , disentangled the casting line , first from her hair , which Ricardo was anxious to cut the great stupid oaf , -- her pretty hair ! -RRB- then from the landing-net ; but Dick had grown sulky ."
1237,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` It 's no use , '' he said ; `` I have not a fly that will suit ."
1238,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Let 's go home , '' and he threw a tin can at a rising trout ."
1239,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Now , Dick , '' said Jaqueline , `` you know I can help you ."
1240,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I did not learn magic for nothing .
1241,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Just you look the other way for a minute or two , and you will find the right fly at the end of your line . ''"
1242,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Dick turned his head away it is not proper to look on at magical arts , and then in a moment , saw the right hook on his cast ; but Jaqueline was not in the boat ."
1243,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She had turned herself into an artificial fly a small black gnat , and Dick might set to his sport again ."
1244,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` What a trump that girl is , '' he said aloud ."
1245,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Clever , too ! '' and he began casting ."
1246,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He got a trout every cast , great big ones , over a pound , and soon he had a basketful ."
1247,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But he began to feel rather bored .
1248,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` There 's not much fun taking them , '' he said , `` when they are so silly . ''"
1249,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"At that very moment he noticed that the fly was off his cast , and Jaqueline was sitting at the oars ."
1250,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` You see , Ricardo , '' she said , `` I was right after all ."
1251,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,There is not much pleasure in sport that is easy and certain .
1252,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Now , apply this moral to dragon-killing with magic instruments ."
1253,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"It may be useful when one is obliged to defend oneself , but surely a prince ought not to give his whole time to nothing else ! ''"
1254,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Dick had no answer ready , so he only grumbled : `` You 're always preaching at me , Jack ; everybody always is ."
1255,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I seem to have been born just to be preached at . ''
1256,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Some people are ; and it does grow rather tedious in the long run .
1257,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But perhaps what Jaqueline said may have made some impression on Ricardo , for he stuck to his books for weeks , and was got into decimal fractions and Euclid ."
1258,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"All this , of course , pleased the king very much , and he began to entertain hopes of Ricardo 's becoming a wise and learned prince , and a credit to his illustrious family ."
1259,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Things were not always to go smoothly , far from it ; and it was poor Jaqueline who fell into trouble next ."
1260,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She had been very ready to lecture Dick , as we saw , and took a good deal of credit to herself for his steadiness ."
1261,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But one day King Prigio happened to meet Jaqueline 's maid , Rosina , on the stairs ; and as Rosina was a pretty girl , and the king was always kind to his dependents , he stopped to have a chat with her ."
1262,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Why , Rosina , what a pretty little silver cross you are wearing , '' he said , and he lifted a curious ornament which hung from a chain on Rosina 's neck ."
1263,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"It consisted of seven drops of silver , set like this : `` May I look at it ? '' his Majesty asked , and Rosina , all in a flutter , took it off and gave if to him ."
1264,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` H 'm ! '' said the king .
1265,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Very curious and pretty !
1266,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"May I ask you where you got this , Rosina ? ''"
1267,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,, `` H 'm ! '' said the king .
1268,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Very curious and pretty ! ''
1269,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,": p73.jpg -RCB- Now Rosina generally had her answer ready , and I am very sorry to say that she did not always speak the truth when she could think of anything better ."
1270,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"On this occasion she was anxious to think of something better , for fear of getting Jaqueline into a scrape about the chemical experiment in her bedroom ."
1271,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But Rosina was fluttered , as we said , by the royal kindness , and she could think of nothing but to curtsy , and say : `` Please , your Majesty , the princess gave me the drops . ''"
1272,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Very interesting , '' said the king ."
1273,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` There is a little white moon shining in each of them !
1274,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I wonder if they shine in the dark ? ''
1275,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He opened the door of a cupboard which had no windows , where the housemaid kept her mops and brooms , and shut himself in ."
1276,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Yes , there was no mistake ; the darkness was quite lighted up with the sheen of the seven little moons in the silver ."
1277,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The king looked rather grave .
1278,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` If you can trust me with this cross till to-morrow , Rosina , I should like to have it examined and analysed ."
1279,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,This is no common silver . ''
1280,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Of course Rosina could only curtsy , but she was very much alarmed about the consequences to her mistress ."
1281,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"After luncheon , the king asked Jaqueline to come into his study , as he often did , to help him with his letters ."
1282,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"When they had sat down his Majesty said : `` My dear Jaqueline , I never interfere with your pursuits , but I almost doubt whether Cornelius Agrippa is a good book for a very young lady to read ."
1283,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The Fairy Paribanou , I am sure , taught you nothing beyond the ordinary magical accomplishments suited to your rank ; but there are a great many things in the Cornelius which I think you should not study till you are older and wiser . ''"
1284,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` What does your Majesty mean ? '' said poor Jaqueline , feeling very uncomfortable ; for the king had never lectured her before ."
1285,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Why , '' said his Majesty , taking the silver cross out of his pocket , `` did you not give this to Rosina ? ''"
1286,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Yes , sire , I did give her the drops ."
1287,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,She had them made up herself . ''
1288,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Then give it back to her when you see her next .
1289,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I am glad you are frank , Jaqueline ."
1290,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And you know , of course , that the drops are not ordinary silver ?"
1291,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"They are moon silver , and that can only be got in one way , so far as I know , at least -- when one spills the water when he , or she , is drinking the moon ."
1292,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Now , there is only one book which tells how that can be done , and there is only one reason for doing it ; namely , to find out what is some other person 's secret ."
1293,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I shall not ask you whose secret you wanted to find out , but I must request you never to do such a thing again without consulting me ."
1294,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"You can have no reason for it , such as a great king might have whose enemies are plotting against his country . ''"
1295,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh , sire , I will tell you everything ! '' cried Jaqueline ."
1296,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` No , don't ; I don't want to know ."
1297,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I am sure you will make no use of your information which you think I should not approve of .
1298,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But there is another thing -- that eclipse of the moon !
1299,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Oh , Jaqueline , was it honourable , or fair to the astronomers and men of science , to say nothing about it ?"
1300,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Their European reputations are seriously injured . ''
1301,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Poor Jaqueline could only cry .
1302,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Never mind , '' said his Majesty , comforting her ."
1303,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` There is no great harm done yet , and perhaps they would not believe you if you did explain ; but just think , if some people ceased to believe in Science , what would they have left to believe in ?"
1304,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But you are young , of course , and can not be expected to think of everything . ''"
1305,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I never thought about it at all , '' wept Jaqueline . ''"
1306,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"` Evil is wrought by want of thought , ' '' said the king , quoting the poet ."
1307,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Now run away , dry your tears , and I think you had better bring me that book , and I 'll put it back in one of the locked-up shelves ."
1308,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Later , when you are older , we shall see about it . ''"
1309,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The princess flew to her room , and returned with her book ."
1310,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And the king kissed her , and told her to go and see if her Majesty meant to take a drive ."
1311,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I 'll never deceive him again , never ... unless it is quite necessary , '' said the princess to herself ."
1312,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Indeed , it is not so easy to deceive the king ."
1313,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,What a lot he has read ! ''
1314,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"In fact , King Prigio had been very studious when a young man , before he came to the throne ."
1315,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Poor child ! '' thought the king .
1316,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` No doubt she was trying her fortune , wondering if Ricardo cares for her a little ."
1317,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Of course I could not let her tell me that , poor child ! ''"
1318,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"In this guess , as we know , his Majesty was mistaken , which seldom happened to him ."
1319,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` I wonder who she is ? '' the king went on speaking to himself .
1320,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` That great booby , Ricardo , saved her from wild birds , which were just going to eat her ."
1321,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She was fastened to a mountain top , but where ? that 's the question ."
1322,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Ricardo never has any notion of geography .
1323,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"It was across the sea , he noticed that ; but which sea , -- Atlantic , Pacific , the Black Sea , the Caspian , the Sea of Marmora , the Red Sea , the Indian Ocean , the German Ocean , the Mediterranean ?"
1324,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Her ornaments were very peculiar ; there was a broad gold sun on her breast .
1325,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I must look at them again some day .
1326,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She said she was being sacrificed to wild birds which her people worshipped , because there was some famine , or war , or trouble in the country ."
1327,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She said she was a Daughter of the Sun ; but that , of course , is absurd , unless -- By Jove !"
1328,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I believe I have it , '' said the king , and he went into the royal library and was looking for some old Spanish book , when his secretary came and said that the Russian Ambassador was waiting for an interview with his Majesty ."
1329,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Dismal old Muscovite ! '' sighed the king .
1330,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` A monarch has not a moment to himself for his private studies .
1331,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Ah , Prigio ! why wert thou not born to a private station ?"
1332,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But Duty before everything , '' and wreathing his royal countenance in smiles , his Majesty prepared to give Count Snoreonski an audience ."
1333,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,It was all about the attitude of Pantouflia in the event of a Polish invasion of Russia .
1334,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The king reassured Count Snoreonski , affirming that Pantouflia , while deeply regretting the disturbed relations between two States in whose welfare she was deeply interested , would ever preserve an attitude of benevolent neutrality , unless her own interests were threatened ."
1335,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I may give your message to my august mistress , the Czarina ? '' said the ambassador ."
1336,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` By all means , adding an expression of my tender interest in her Majesty 's health and welfare , '' said the king , presenting the count at the same time with a magnificent diamond snuffbox containing his portrait ."
1337,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The old count was affected to tears , and withdrew , while King Prigio said : `` I have not lost a day ; I have made an amiable but very stupid man happy . ''"
1338,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Such are , or rather such were , the toils of monarchs !"
1339,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"King Prigio had gone to a distant part of his dominions , on business of importance , and the young people were sitting in the royal study ."
1340,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The letter , which Ricardo handed to Jaqueline , was written on a great broad sheet of paper , folded up without any envelope , as was the custom then , and was sealed with a huge seal in red wax ."
1341,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I don't know the arms , '' Ricardo said ."
1342,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh , Ricardo , how you do neglect your Heraldry !"
1343,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Old Green Stocking is in despair over your ignorance . ''
1344,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Now Green Stocking was the chief herald of Pantouflia , just like Blue Mantle in England ."
1345,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Why , these are the Royal Arms of England , you great ignorant Dick ! ''"
1346,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` But Rome is n't in England , is it ? -- and the post-mark is ` Roma ' : that 's Rome in some lingo , I expect ."
1347,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"It is in Latin , anyhow , I know ."
1348,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Mortuus est Romae -- ` He died at Rome . '
1349,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,It 's in the Latin Grammar .
1350,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Let 's see what the fellow says , anyhow , '' added Ricardo , breaking the seal ."
1351,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` He begins , ` Prins and dear Cousin ! '"
1352,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I say , Jaqueline , he spells it ` Prins ; ' now it is P-R-I-N-C-E ."
1353,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,He must be an ignorant fellow ! ''
1354,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` People in glass houses should not throw stones , Dick , '' said Jaqueline ."
1355,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` He signs himself ` Charles , P. W. , ' '' said Ricardo , looking at the end ."
1356,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Who on earth can he be ?
1357,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Why does he not put ` P. W. Charles , ' if these are his initials ?"
1358,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Look here , it 's rather a long letter ; you might read it to us , Jack ! ''"
1359,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The princess took the epistle and began : `` How nice it smells , all scented !"
1360,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The paper is gilt-edged , too . ''"
1361,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Luxurious beggar , whoever he is , '' said Ricardo ."
1362,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Well , he says : ` Prins and dear Cousin , -- You and me ' oh , what grammar ! -RRB-"
1363,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"` are much the same age , I being fifteen next birthday , and we should be better ackwainted ."
1364,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"All the wurld has herd of the fame of Prins Ricardo , whose name is feerd , and his sord dreded , wherever there are Monsters and Tirants ."
1365,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Prins , you may be less well informed about my situation ."
1366,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I have not killed any Dragguns , there being nun of them here ; but I have been under fiar , at Gaeta . '"
1367,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Where 's Gaeta , Dick ? ''"
1368,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Never heard of it , '' said Ricardo ."
1369,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Well , it is in Italy , and it was besieged lately ."
1370,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He goes on : ` and I am told that I did not misbehave myself , nor disgrace the blud of Bruce . ' ''"
1371,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I 've heard of Robert Bruce , '' said Dick ; `` he was the man who did not kill the spider , but he cracked the head of Sir Harry Bohun with one whack of his axe ."
1372,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I remember him well enough . ''
1373,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Well , your correspondent seems to be a descendant of his . ''"
1374,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` That 's getting more interesting , '' said Dick ."
1375,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` I wish my father would go to war with somebody .
1376,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,With the Sword of Sharpness I 'd make the enemy whistle !

1378,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"` As a prins in distress , I apeal to your valler , so renouned in Europe ."
1379,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I am kept out of my own ; my royal father , King Gems , ' -- well , this is the worst spelling I ever saw in my life !"
1380,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He means King James , -- ` my royal father , King Gems , being druv into exile by a crewl Usurper , the Elector of Hannover ."
1381,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"King Gems is old , and likes a quiat life ; but I am determined to make an effort , if I go alone , and Europe shall here of Prince Charles ."
1382,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Having heard -- as who has not ? -- of your royal Highness 's courage and sordsmanship , I throw myself at your feet , and implore you to asist a prins in distres ."
1383,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Let our sords be drawn together in the caus of freedom and an outraged country , my own . '' '"
1384,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I remain , '' ` Prins and dear Cuzen , '' ` CHARLES , P. W. ' `` P. W. means Prince of Wales , '' added Jaqueline ."
1385,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` He is turned out of England you know , and lives at Rome with his father . ''"
1386,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I like that chap , '' said Prince Ricardo ."
1387,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` He does not spell very well , as you say , but I sometimes make mistakes myself ; and I like his spirit ."
1388,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I 've been looking out for an adventure ; but the big game is getting shy , and my sword rusts in his scabbard ."
1389,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I 'll tell you what , Jack -- I 've an idea !"
1390,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I 'll put him on the throne of his fathers ; it 's as easy as shelling peas : and as for that other fellow , the Elector , I 'll send him back to Hanover , wherever that may be , and he can go on electing , and polling his vote in peace and quietness , at home ."
1391,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Just wait till I spot the places . ''
1392,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The prince ran up to the turret , fetched the magic spy-glass , and looked up London , Rome , and Hanover , as you would in a map ."
1393,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Well , Dick , but how do you mean to do it ? ''"
1394,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Do it ? -- nothing simpler !
1395,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I just take my Seven-league Boots , run over to Rome , pick up Prince Charles , put him on the magic carpet , fly to London , clap the Cap of Darkness on him so that nobody can see him , set him down on the throne of his fathers ; pick up the Elector , carry him over to his beloved Hanover , and the trick is done -- what they call a bloodless revolution in the history books .

1396,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` But if the English don't like Prince Charles when they get him ? ''
1397,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Like him ? they 're sure to like him , a young fellow like that !"
1398,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Besides , I 'll take the sword with me in case of accidents . ''"
1399,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` But , Dick , it is your father 's rule that you are never to meddle in the affairs of other countries , and never to start on an expedition when he is not at home . ''"
1400,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh , he wo n't mind this time !"
1401,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,There 's no kind of danger ; and I 'm sure he will approve of the principle of the thing .
1402,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Kings must stick up for each other .
1403,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Why , some electing characters might come here and kick us out ! ''"
1404,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Your father is not the sort of king who is kicked out , '' said Jaqueline ."
1405,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But there was no use in talking to Dick .
1406,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He made his simple preparations , and announced that he would be back in time for luncheon ."
1407,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,What was poor Jaqueline to do ?
1408,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,She was extremely anxious .
1409,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She knew , as we saw , what King Prigio had intended about changing the fairy things for others that would not work ."
1410,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,She was certain Dick would get himself into a scrape ; how was she to help him ?
1411,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She made up her mind quickly , while Dick was putting his things together ."
1412,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,She told the queen it was the nearest to the truth she could think of that she `` was going for a turn with Dick . ''
1413,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Then she changed herself into a mosquito -- a kind of gnat that bites -- and hid herself under a fold of Dick 's coat .
1414,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Of course he knew nothing about her being there .
1415,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then he started off in his Seven - league Boots , and before you could say `` Jack Robinson '' he was in Rome , in the grounds of a splendid palace called the Villa Borghese ."
1416,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"There he saw an elderly gentleman , in a great curled wig , sound asleep on a seat beneath a tree ."
1417,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The old gentleman had a long , pale , melancholy face , and across his breast was a broad blue ribbon with a star ."
1418,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Ah ! how changed was King James from the handsome Prince who had loved fair Beatrix Esmond , thirty years ago !"
1419,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Near him were two boys , not quite so old as Prince Ricardo ."
1420,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The younger was a pretty dark boy , with a funny little roundabout white wig ."
1421,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He was splendidly dressed in a light-blue silk coat ; a delicate little lace scarf was tied round his neck ; he had lace ruffles falling about his little ringed hands ; he had a pretty sword , with a gold handle set with diamonds -- in fact , he was the picture of a little dandy ."
1422,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The other lad had a broad Scotch bonnet on , and no wig ; beautiful silky yellow locks fell about his shoulders ."
1423,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,He had laid his sword on the grass .
1424,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He was dressed in tartan , which Ricardo had never seen before ; and he wore a kilt , which was also new to Ricardo , who wondered at his bare legs -- for he was wearing shoes with no stockings ."
1425,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"In his hand he held a curious club , with a long , slim handle , and a head made heavy with lead , and defended with horn ."
1426,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"With this he was aiming at a little white ball ; and suddenly he swung up the club and sent the ball out of sight in the air , over several trees ."
1427,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Prince Ricardo stepped up to this boy , took off his cap , and said : `` I think I have the honour of addressing the Prince of Wales ? ''"
1428,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Prince Charles started at the sight of a gentleman in long riding-boots , girt with a broadsword , which was not then generally worn , and carrying a Persian rug under his arm ."
1429,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` That is what I am called , sir , '' he said , `` by those who give me the title which is mine by right ."
1430,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,May I inquire the reason which offers me the pleasure of this unexpected interview ? ''
1431,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh , I 'm Ricardo of Pantouflia ! '' says Dick ."
1432,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I had a letter from you this morning , and I believe you wanted to see me . ''"
1433,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` From Pantouflia , sir , '' said Prince Charles ; `` why , that is hundreds of leagues away ! ''"
1434,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` It is a good distance , '' said Dick ; `` but a mere step when you wear Seven - league Boots like mine . ''"
1435,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` My dear prince , '' said Charles , throwing himself into his arms with rapture , and kissing him in the Italian fashion , which Dick did not half like , `` you are , indeed , worthy of your reputation ; and these are the celebrated Seven-league Boots ?"
1436,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Harry , '' he cried to his brother , `` come here at once and let me present you to his Royal Highness , our illustrious ally , Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia ."
1437,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The Duke of York -- Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia .
1438,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Gentlemen , know each other ! ''"
1439,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The prince bowed in the most stately manner .
1440,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I say , '' said Dick , who was seldom at all up to the standard of royal conversation , `` what 's that game you were playing ?"
1441,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,It 's new to me .
1442,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,You sent the ball a tremendous long shot . ''
1443,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` The game is called golf , and is the favourite pastime of my loyal Scottish subjects , '' said Prince Charles ."
1444,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` For that reason , that I may be able to share the amusements of my people , whom I soon hope to lead to a glorious victory , followed by a peaceful and prosperous reign , I am acquiring a difficult art ."
1445,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I 'm practising walking without stockings , too , to harden my feet , '' he said , in a more familiar tone of voice ."
1446,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I fancy there are plenty of long marches before me , and I would not be a spear 's length behind the hardiest Highlander . ''"
1447,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` By Jove !
1448,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I respect you , '' said Dick , with the greatest sincerity ; `` but I don't think , with me on your side , you will need to make many marches ."
1449,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,It will all be plain sailing . ''
1450,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Pray explain your plan , '' said Prince Charles ."
1451,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` The task of conquering back the throne of my fathers is not so simple as you seem to suppose . ''
1452,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I 've done a good many difficult things , '' said Dick , modestly ."
1453,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` The conqueror of the magician , Gorgonzola , and the Giant Who never Knew when he had Enough , need not tell me that , '' said Prince Charles , with a courteous allusion to two of Ricardo 's most prodigious adventures ."
1454,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Oh !
1455,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I 've very little to be proud of , really , '' said Dick , blushing ; `` anyone could do as much with my fairy things , of which , no doubt , you have heard ."
1456,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"With a Sword of Sharpness and a Cap of Darkness , and so forth , you have a great pull over almost anything . ''"
1457,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` And you really possess those talismans ? '' said the prince .
1458,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Certainly I do .
1459,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,You see how short a time I took in coming to your call from Pantouflia . ''
1460,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` And has Holy Church , '' asked the Duke of York , with anxiety , `` given her sanction and her blessing to those instruments of an art , usually , in her wisdom , forbidden ? ''"
1461,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh , never mind Holy Church , Harry ! '' said Prince Charles ."
1462,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` This is business .
1463,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Besides , the English are Protestants . ''"
1464,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I pray for their conversion daily , '' said the Duke of York ."
1465,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` The end justifies the means , you know , '' answered Prince Charles ."
1466,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` All 's fair in love and war . ''
1467,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I should think so , '' said Ricardo , `` especially against those brutes of Electors ; they give trouble at home sometimes . ''"
1468,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` You , too , are plagued with an Elector ? '' asked Prince Charles . ''"
1469,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"An Elector ? thousands of them ! '' answered Dick , who never could understand anything about politics ."
1470,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Prince Charles looked puzzled , but requested Dick to explain his great plan ."
1471,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"They sat down on the grass , and Ricardo showed them how he meant to manage it , just as he had told Jaqueline ."
1472,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"As he said , nothing could be simpler ."
1473,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Let 's start at once , '' he said , and , inducing Prince Charles to sit down on the magic carpet , he cried : `` England !"
1474,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,St. James 's Palace ! ''
1475,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But nothing happened !
1476,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The carpet was not the right magic carpet , but the one which King Prigio had put in its place ."

1478,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"England , I said ! '' cried Dick ."
1479,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But there they remained , under the chestnut tree , sitting on the carpet above the flowery grass ."
1480,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Prince Charles leaped to his feet ; his face like fire , his eyes glowing ."
1481,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Enough of this fooling , sir ! '' he said ."
1482,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` It is easy , but cowardly , to mock at an unfortunate prince ."
1483,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Take your carpet and be off with you , out of the gardens , or your shoulders shall taste my club . ''"
1484,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` There has been some mistake , '' Ricardo said ; `` the wrong carpet has been brought by accident , or the carpet has lost its power . ''"
1485,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` In this sacred city , blessed by the presence of his Holiness the Pope , and the relics of so many martyrs and saints , magic may well cease to be potent , '' said the Duke of York ."
1486,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Nonsense !
1487,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"You are an impostor , sir !"
1488,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Leave my presence ! '' cried Prince Charles , lifting his golf-club ."
1489,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Dick caught it out of his hand , and broke across his knee as fine a driver as ever came from Robertson 's shop at St. Andrew 's ."
1490,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` The quarrels of princes are not settled with clubs , sir !"
1491,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Draw and defend yourself ! '' he said , kicking off his boots and standing in his socks on the grass ."
1492,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Think of the horror of poor Jaqueline , who witnessed this terrible scene of passion from a fold in Prince Ricardo 's dress !"
1493,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"What could the girl do to save the life of two princes , the hopes of one nation , and of a respectable minority in another ?"
1494,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"In a moment Prince Charles 's rapier was shining in the sunlight , and he fell on guard in the most elegant attitude , his left hand gracefully raised and curved ."
1495,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Dick drew his sword , but , as suddenly , threw it down again ."
1496,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Hang it ! '' he exclaimed , `` I ca n't hit you with this !"
1497,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,This is the Sword of Sharpness ; it would cut through your steel and your neck at a touch . ''
1498,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He paused , and thought ."
1499,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Let me beseech your Royal Highness , '' he said to the Duke of York , who was in a terrible taking , `` to lend your blade to a hand not less royal than your own . ''"
1500,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Give him it , Hal ! '' said Prince Charles , who was standing with the point of his sword on the ground , and the blade bent ."
1501,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` He seems to believe in his own nonsense . ''
1502,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The duke yielded his sword ; Dick took it , made a nourish , and rushed at Prince Charles ."
1503,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Now Ricardo had always neglected his fencing lessons .
1504,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Where 's the good of it , '' he used to ask , `` all that stamping , and posture-making , and ha - haing ?"
1505,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The Sword of Sharpness is enough for me . ''
1506,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But now he could not , in honour , use the Sword of Sharpness ; so on he came , waving the rapier like a claymore , and made a slice at Prince Charles 's head ."
1507,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The prince , very much surprised , parried in prime , riposted , and touched Dick on the hand ."
1508,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,At this moment the Princess Jaqueline did what she should have thought of sooner .
1509,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She flew out of Dick 's coat , and stung old King James on his royal nose ."
1510,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The king wakened , nearly crushed the princess so dangerous is the practice of magic to the artist , and then leaped up , and saw Dick 's blade flying through the air , glittering in the sun ."
1511,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The prince had disarmed him .
1512,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Hullo ! what 's all this ?
1513,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"A moi , mes gardes ! '' cried the old king , in French and English ; and then he ran up , just in time to hear Prince Charles say : `` Sir , take your life !"
1514,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I can not strike an unarmed man .
1515,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"A prince you may be , but you have not learned the exercises of gentlemen . ''"
1516,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` What is all this , Carluccio ? '' asked the old king ."
1517,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Swords out ! brawling in my very presence ! blood drawn ! '' for Dick 's hand was bleeding a good deal .
1518,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Prince Charles , as briefly as possible , explained the unusual nature of the circumstances ."
1519,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` A king must hear both sides , '' said King James ."
1520,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` What reply have you , sir , to make to his Royal Highness 's statements ? ''"
1521,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` The carpet would not work , sir , '' said Dick ."
1522,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` It never happened before .
1523,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Had I used my own sword , '' and he explained its properties , `` the Prince of Wales would not be alive to tell his story ."
1524,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I can say no more , beyond offering my apology for a disappointment which I could not have foreseen ."
1525,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,A gentleman can only say that he is sorry .
1526,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But wait ! '' he added ; `` I can at least prove that my confidence in some of my resources is not misplaced .
1527,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Bid me bring you something -- anything -- from the ends of the earth , and it shall be in your hands ."
1528,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I ca n't say fairer . ''
1529,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"King James reflected , while Prince Ricardo was pulling on the Seven-league Boots , which he had kicked off to fight more freely , and while the Duke of York bandaged Dick 's hand with a kerchief ."
1530,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Bring me , '' said his Majesty , `` Lord Lovat 's snuff-mull . ''"
1531,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Where does he live ? '' said Dick .
1532,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` At Gortuleg , in Scotland , '' answered King James ."
1533,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Dick was out of sight before the words were fairly spoken , and in ten minutes was back , bearing a large ram 's - horn snuff-box , with a big cairngorm set in the top , and the Frazer arms ."
1534,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Most astonishing ! '' said King James .
1535,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` A miracle ! '' said the Duke of York .
1536,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` You have entirely cleared your character , '' said the king ."
1537,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Your honour is without a stain , though it is a pity about the carpet ."
1538,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Your nobility in not using your magical sword , under the greatest provocation , reconciles me to this fresh blighting of my hopes ."
1539,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"All my allies fail me , '' said the poor king with a sigh ; `` you alone have failed with honour ."
1540,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Carluccio , embrace the prince ! ''"
1541,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,They fell into each other 's arms .
1542,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Prince , '' said Dick , `` you have taught me a lesson for which I shall not be ungrateful ."
1543,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,With any blade a gentleman should be able to hold his own in fair fight .
1544,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I shall no longer neglect my fencing lessons . ''
1545,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` With any blade , '' said Prince Charles , `` I shall be happy to find Prince Ricardo by my side in a stricken field ."
1546,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,We shall not part till I have induced you to accept a sword which I can never hope to draw against another adversary so noble .
1547,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"In war , my weapon is the claymore . ''"
1548,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Here the prince offered to Ricardo the ruby-studded hilt of his rapier , which had a beautiful white shark-skin sheath ."
1549,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` You must accept it , sir , '' said King James ; `` the hilt holds the rubies of John Sobieski . ''"
1550,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Thank you , prince , '' said Ricardo , `` for the weapon , which I shall learn to wield ; and I entreat you to honour me by receiving this fairy gift -- which you do not need -- a ring which makes all men faithful to the wearer . ''"
1551,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The Prince of Wales bowed , and placed the talisman on his finger ."
1552,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Ricardo then , after a few words of courtesy on both parts , picked up his useless carpet , took his farewell of the royal party , and , with Jaqueline still hidden under his collar , returned at full speed , but with a heavy heart , to Pantouflia , where the palace gong was just sounding for luncheon ."
1553,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Ricardo never interfered in foreign affairs again , but his ring proved very useful to Prince Charles , as you may have read in history ."
1554,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The queen , as it happened fortunately , was lunching with one of the ladies of her Court ."
1555,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Ricardo did not come down to luncheon , and Jaqueline ate hers alone ; and very mournful she felt ."
1556,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The prince had certainly not come well out of the adventure .
1557,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He had failed as all attempts to restore the Stuarts always did ; he had been wounded , though he had never received a scratch in any of his earlier exploits ; and if his honour was safe , and his good intentions fully understood , that was chiefly due to Jaqueline , and to the generosity of King James and Prince Charles ."
1558,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I wonder what he 's doing ? '' she said to herself , and at last she went up and knocked at Ricardo 's door ."
1559,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Go away , '' he said ; `` I don't want to see anybody ."
1560,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Who is it ? ''
1561,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` It 's only me -- Jaqueline . ''
1562,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Go away !
1563,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I want nobody . ''
1564,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Do let me in , dear Dick ; I have good news for you , '' said the princess ."
1565,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` What is it ? '' said Ricardo , unlocking the door ."
1566,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Why do you bother a fellow so ? ''
1567,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He had been crying -- his hand obviously hurt him badly ; he looked , and indeed he was , very sulky ."
1568,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` How did you get on in England , Dick ? '' asked the princess , taking no notice of his bandaged hand ."
1569,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh , don't ask me ! '' said Ricardo ."
1570,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` I 've not been to England at all . ''
1571,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Why , what happened ? ''"
1572,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Everything that is horrid happened , '' said Dick ; and then , unable to keep it any longer to himself , he said : `` I 've failed to keep my promise ; I 've been insulted , I 've been beaten by a fellow younger than myself ; and , oh ! how my hand does hurt , and I 've got such a headache !"
1573,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,And what am I to say to my mother when she asks why my arm is in a sling ? and what will my father say ?
1574,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I 'm quite broken down and desperate .
1575,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I think I 'll run away to sea ; '' and indeed he looked very wild and miserable .
1576,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Tell me how it all happened , Dick , '' said the princess ; `` I 'm sure it 's not so bad as you make out ."
1577,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Perhaps I can help you . ''
1578,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` How can a girl help a man ? '' cried Dick , angrily ; and poor Jaqueline , remembering how she had helped him , at the risk of her own life , when King James nearly crushed her in the shape of a mosquito , turned her head away , and cried silently ."
1579,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I 'm a beast , '' said Dick ."
1580,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I beg your pardon , Jack dear ."
1581,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"You are always a trump , I will say ; but I don't see what you can do . ''"
1582,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then he told her all the story which , of course , she knew perfectly well already , except the part played by the mosquito , of which he could not be aware ."
1583,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I was sure it was not so bad as you made it out , Dick , '' she said ."
1584,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` You see , the old king , who is not very wise , but is a perfectly honourable gentleman , gave you the highest praise . ''"
1585,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She thought of lecturing him a little about disobeying his father , but it did not seem a good opportunity ."
1586,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Besides , Jaqueline had been lectured herself lately , and had not enjoyed it ."
1587,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` What am I to say to my mother ? ''
1588,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Dick repeated .
1589,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` We must think of something to say , '' said Jaqueline ."
1590,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I ca n't tell my mother anything but the truth , '' Ricardo went on ."
1591,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Here 's my hand , how it does sting ! and she must find out . ''"
1592,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I think I can cure it , '' said Jaqueline ."
1593,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Did n't you say Prince Charles gave you his own sword ? ''
1594,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Yes , there it is ; but what has that to do with it ? ''"
1595,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Everything in the world to do with it , my dear Dick ."
1596,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,How lucky it is that he gave it to you ! ''
1597,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And she ran to her own room , and brought a beautiful golden casket , which contained her medicines ."
1598,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Taking out a small phial , marked in letters of emerald : `` WEAPON SALVE , '' the princess drew the bright sword , extracted a little of the ointment from the phial , and spread it on a soft silk handkerchief ."
1599,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` What are you going to do with the sword ? '' asked Ricardo .
1600,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Polish it a little , '' said Jaqueline , smiling , and she began gently to rub , with the salve , the point of the rapier ."
1601,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"As she did so , Ricardo 's arm ceased to hurt , and the look of pain passed from his mouth ."
1602,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Why , I feel quite better ! '' he said ."
1603,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` I can use my hand as well as ever . ''
1604,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then he took off the stained handkerchief , and , lo , there was not even a mark where the wound had been !"
1605,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"For this was the famous Weapon Salve which you may read about in Sir Kenelm Digby , and which the Lady of Branxholme used , in The Lay of the Last Minstrel ."
1606,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But the secret of making it has long been lost , except in Pantouflia ."
1607,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` You are the best girl in the world , Jaqueline , '' said Ricardo ."
1608,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` You may give me a kiss if you like ; and I wo n't call you ` Jack , ' or laugh at you for reading books , any more ."
1609,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,There 's something in books after all . ''
1610,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The princess did not take advantage of Dick 's permission , but advised him to lie down and try to sleep ."
1611,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I say , though , '' he said , `` what about my father ? ''"
1612,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` The king need never be told anything about it , '' said Jaqueline , `` need he ? ''"
1613,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh , that wo n't do !"
1614,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I tell my father everything ; but then , I never had anything like this to tell him before ."
1615,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Do n't you think , Jaqueline , you might break it to him ?"
1616,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,He 's very fond of you .
1617,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Just tell him what I told you ; it 's every word of it true , and he ought to know ."
1618,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,He might see something about it in the Mercure de France . ''
1619,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,This was the newspaper of the period .
1620,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I don't think it will get into the papers , '' said Jaqueline , smiling ."
1621,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Nobody could tell , except the king and the princes , and they have reasons for keeping it to themselves . ''"
1622,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I don't trust that younger one , '' said Dick , moodily ; `` I don't care for that young man ."
1623,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Anyway , my father must be told ; and , if you wo n't , I must . ''"
1624,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Well , I 'll tell him , '' said Jaqueline ."
1625,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` And now lie down till evening . ''
1626,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"After dinner , in the conservatory , Jaqueline told King Prigio all about it ."
1627,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,His Majesty was very much moved .
1628,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` What extraordinary bad luck that family has ! '' he thought .
1629,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` If I had not changed the rug , the merest accident , Prince Charles would have dined at St. James 's to-night , and King George in Hanover ."
1630,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,It was the very nearest thing ! ''
1631,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` This meddling with practical affairs will never do , '' he said aloud ."
1632,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Dick has had a lesson , sire , '' said the princess ."
1633,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` He says he 'll never mix himself up with politics again , whatever happens ."
1634,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And he says he means to study all about them , for he feels frightfully ignorant , and , above all , he means to practise his fencing . ''"
1635,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"These remarks were not part of the conversation between Ricardo and Jaqueline , but she considered that Dick meant all this , and , really , he did ."
1636,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` That is well , as far as it goes , '' said the king ."
1637,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` But , Jaqueline , about that mosquito ? '' for she had told him this part of the adventure ."
1638,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` That was a very convenient mosquito , though I don't know how Dick was able to observe it from any distance ."
1639,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I see your hand in that , my dear , and I am glad you can make such kind and wise use of the lessons of the good Fairy Paribanou ."
1640,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Jaqueline , '' he added solemnly , laying his hand on her head , `` You have saved the honour of Pantouflia , which is dearer to me than life ."
1641,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Without your help , I tremble to think what might have occurred . ''"
1642,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The princess blushed very much , and felt very happy ."
1643,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Now run away to the queen , my dear , '' said his Majesty , `` I want to think things over . ''"
1644,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He did think them over , and the more he thought the more he felt the inconvenience attending the possession of fairy things ."
1645,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` An eclipse one day , as nearly as possible a revolution soon after ! '' he said to himself ."
1646,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` But for Jaqueline , Ricardo 's conduct would have been blazed abroad , England would have been irritated ."
1647,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"It is true she can not get at Pantouflia very easily ; we have no sea-coast , and we are surrounded by friendly countries ."
1648,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But it would have been a ticklish and discreditable position .
1649,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I must really speak to Dick , '' which he did next morning after breakfast ."
1650,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` You have broken my rules , Ricardo , '' he said ."
1651,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` True , there is no great harm done , and you have confessed frankly ; but how am I to trust you any longer ? ''"
1652,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I 'll give you my sacred word of honour , father , that I 'll never meddle with politics again , or start on an expedition , without telling you ."
1653,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I have had enough of it .

1655,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I 've learned to be ashamed of my ignorance ; and I 've sent for Francalanza , and I 'll fence every day , and read like anything . ''"
1656,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Very good , '' said the king ."
1657,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` I believe you mean what you say .

1661,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Some enchanter may have deprived it of its power , it may be worn out , someone may have substituted a common Persian rug ; anything may happen ."

1665,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The prince ran off , and presently the sounds of stamping feet and '' un , deux ; doublez , degagez , vite ; contre de carte , '' and so forth , might be heard over a great part of the royal establishment ."
1666,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` There is one brute I wish I could get upsides with , '' said Ricardo , at breakfast one morning , his mouth full of sardine ."
1667,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Really , Ricardo , your language is most unprincely , '' said his august father ; `` I am always noticing it ."
1668,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"You mean , I suppose , that there is one enemy of the human race whom you wish to abolish ."
1669,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,What is the name of the doomed foe ? ''

1675,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"You may here remark that , since Dick took to his studies , he could speak , when he chose , like a printed book , which was by no means the case before ."
1676,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` If you remember , sir , he polished off -- I mean , he slew -- the King of the Golden Mines and the beautiful , though frivolous , Princess Frutilla ."

1685,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` They say he is very cunning of fence , '' said the king ; `` and besides , I have heard something of a diamond sword that he stole from the King of the Golden Mines . ''"
1686,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Very likely he has lost it or sold it , the shabby little miscreant ; however , I 'll risk it ."
1687,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,And now I must make my preparations . ''
1688,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The king did not ask what they were ; as a rule , they were simple ."
1689,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But , being in the shop of the optician that day , standing with his back to the door , he heard Dick come in and order a pair of rose-coloured spectacles , with which he was at once provided ."
1690,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The people of Pantouflia were accustomed to wear them , saying that they improved the complexions of ladies whom they met , and added cheerfulness to things in general ."
1691,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Just plain rose-coloured glass , Herr Spex , '' said Dick , `` I 'm not short - sighted . ''"
1692,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` The boy is beginning to show some sense , '' said the king to himself , knowing the nature and the difficulties of the expedition ."
1693,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Ricardo did not disguise his intention of taking with him a Dandie Dinmont terrier , named Pepper , and the king , who understood the motive of this precaution , silently approved ."
1694,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` The lad has come to some purpose and forethought , '' the king said , and he gladly advanced a considerable sum for the purchase of crocodiles ' eggs , which can rarely be got quite fresh ."
1695,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"When Jaqueline had made the crocodiles ' eggs , with millet-seed and sugar-candy , into a cake for the Dwarf 's lions , Ricardo announced that his preparations were complete ."
1696,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Not to be the mere slave of custom , he made this expedition on horseback , and the only magical thing he took with him was the Cap of Darkness the one which would not work , but he did not know that , and this he put in his pocket for future use ."
1697,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"With plenty of egg sandwiches and marmalade sandwiches , and cold minced-collop sandwiches , he pricked forth into the wilderness , making for the country inhabited by the Yellow Dwarf ."
1698,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The princess was glad he was riding , for she privately accompanied him in the disguise of a wasp ; and a wasp , of course , could not have kept up with him in his Seven-league Boots ."
1699,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Hang that wops ! '' said Prince Ricardo several times , buffeting it with his pocket-handkerchief when it buzzed in his ear and round his horse 's head ."
1700,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,," `` Hang that wops ! '' said Prince Ricardo : p129.jpg -RCB- Meanwhile , King Prigio had taken his precautions , which were perfectly simple ."
1701,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"When he thought Ricardo was getting near the place , the king put on his Wishing Cap , sat down before the magic crystal ball , and kept his eye on the proceedings , being ready to wish the right thing to help Ricardo at the right moment ."
1702,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He left the window wide open , smoked his cigar , and seemed the pattern of a good and wise father watching the conduct of a promising son ."
1703,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The prince rode and rode , sometimes taking up Pepper on his saddle ; passing through forests , sleeping at lonely inns , fording rivers , till one day he saw that the air was becoming Yellow ."
1704,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He knew that this showed the neighbourhood of Jaunia , or Daunia , the country of the Yellow Dwarf ."
1705,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He therefore drew bridle , placed his rose-coloured spectacles on his nose and put spurs to his horse , for the yellow light of Jaunia makes people melancholy and cowardly ."
1706,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"As he pricked on , his horse stumbled and nearly came on its nose ."
1707,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The prince noticed that a steel chain had been drawn across the road .
1708,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` What caitiff has dared ! '' he exclaimed , when his hat was knocked off by a well-aimed orange from a neighbouring orange-tree , and a vulgar voice squeaked : `` Hi , Blinkers ! ''"
1709,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"There was the Yellow Dwarf , an odious little figure , sitting sucking an orange in the tree , swinging his wooden shoes , and grinning all over his wrinkled face ."
1710,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Well , young Blinkers ! '' said the Dwarf , `` what are you doing on my grounds ?"
1711,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"You 're a prince , by your look ."
1712,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Yah ! down with kings !
1713,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I 'm a man of the people ! ''
1714,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` You 're a dwarf of the worst description , that 's what you are , '' said Ricardo ; `` and let me catch you , and I 'll flog the life out of you with my riding-whip ! ''"
1715,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The very face of the Dwarf , even seen through rose-coloured spectacles , made him nearly ill ."
1716,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Yes , when you can catch me , '' said the Dwarf ; `` but that 's not to-day , nor yet to-morrow ."
1717,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,What are you doing here ?
1718,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Are you an ambassador , maybe come to propose a match for me ?"
1719,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I 'm not proud , I 'll hear you ."
1720,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"They say there 's a rather well-looking wench in your parts , the Princess Jaqueline -- '' `` Mention that lady 's name , you villain , '' cried Dick , `` and I 'll cut down your orange-tree ! '' and he wished he had brought the Sword of Sharpness , for you can not prod down a tree with the point of a rapier ."
1721,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Fancy her yourself ? '' said the Dwarf , showing his yellow teeth with a detestable grin ; while Ricardo turned quite white with anger , and not knowing how to deal with this insufferable little monster ."
1722,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I 'm a widower , I am , '' said the Dwarf , `` though I 'm out of mourning , '' for he wore a dirty clay-coloured Yellow jacket ."
1723,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` My illustrious consort , the Princess Frutilla , did not behave very nice , and I had to avenge my honour ; in fact , I 'm open to any offers , however humble ."
1724,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Going at an alarming sacrifice !
1725,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Come to my box '' and he pointed to a filthy clay cottage , all surrounded by thistles , nettles , and black boggy water , `` and I 'll talk over your proposals . ''"
1726,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Hold your impudent tongue ! '' said Dick .
1727,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` The Princess Frutilla was an injured saint ; and as for the lady whom I shall not name in your polluting presence , I am her knight , and I defy you to deadly combat ! ''"
1728,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"We may imagine how glad the princess was when disguised as a wasp she heard Dick say he was her knight ; not that , in fact , he had thought of it before ."
1729,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh ! you 're for a fight , are you ? '' sneered the Dwarf ."
1730,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I might tell you to hit one of your own weight , but I 'm not afraid of six of you ."
1731,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Yah ! mammy 's brat !
1732,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Look here , young Blinkers , I don't want to hurt you ."
1733,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Just turn old Dobbin 's head , and trot back to your mammy , Queen Rosalind , at Pantouflia ."
1734,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Does she know you 're out ? ''
1735,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I 'll be into you , pretty quick , '' said Ricardo ."
1736,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` But why do I bandy words with a miserable peasant ? ''
1737,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` And don't get much the best of them either , '' said the Dwarf , provokingly ."
1738,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` But I 'll fight , if you will have it . ''"
1739,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The prince leaped from his horse , leaving Pepper on the saddle-bow ."
1740,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"No sooner had he touched the ground than the Dwarf shouted : `` Hi ! to him , Billy ! to him , Daniel ! at him , good lions , at him ! '' and , with an awful roar , two lions rushed from a neighbouring potato-patch and made for Ricardo ."
1741,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"These were not ordinary lions , history avers , each having two heads , each being eight feet high , with four rows of teeth ; their skins as hard as nails , and bright red , like morocco ."
1742,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The prince did not lose his presence of mind ; hastily he threw the cake of crocodiles ' eggs , millet-seed , and sugar-candy to the lions ."
1743,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"This is a dainty which lions can never resist , and running greedily at it , with four tremendous snaps , they got hold of each other by their jaws , and their eight rows of teeth were locked fast in a grim and deadly struggle for existence !"
1744,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The Dwarf took in the affair at a glance .
1745,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Cursed be he who taught you this ! '' he cried , and then whistled in a shrill and vulgar manner on his very dirty fingers ."
1746,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"At his call rushed up an enormous Spanish cat , ready saddled and bridled , and darting fire from its eyes ."
1747,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"To leap on its back , while Ricardo sprang on his own steed , was to the active Dwarf the work of a moment ."
1748,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then clapping spurs to its sides his spurs grew naturally on his bare heels , horrible to relate , like a cock 's spurs and taking his cat by the head , the Dwarf forced it to leap on to Ricardo 's saddle ."
1749,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The diamond sword which slew the king of the Golden Mines -- that invincible sword which hews iron like a reed -- was up and flashing in the air !
1750,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"At this very moment King Prigio , seeing , in the magic globe , all that passed , and despairing of Ricardo 's life , was just about to wish the dwarf at Jericho , when through the open window , with a tremendous whirr , came a huge vulture , and knocked the king 's wishing cap off !"
1751,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Wishing was now of no use .
1752,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"This odious fowl was the Fairy of the Desert , the Dwarf 's trusted ally in every sort of mischief ."
1753,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The vulture flew instantly out of the window ; and ah ! with what awful anxiety the king again turned his eyes on the crystal ball only a parent 's heart can know .
1754,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Should he see Ricardo bleeding at the feet of the abominable dwarf ?
1755,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The king scarcely dared to look ; never before had he known the nature of fear .
1756,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"However , look he did , and saw the dwarf un-catted , and Pepper , the gallant Dandie Dinmont , with his teeth in the throat of the monstrous Spanish cat ."
1757,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"No sooner had he seen the cat leap on his master 's saddle-bow than Pepper , true to the instinct of his race , sprang at its neck , just behind the head -- the usual place , -- and , with an awful and despairing mew , the cat Peter was its name gave up its life ."
1758,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The dwarf was on his feet in a moment , waving the diamond sword , which lighted up the whole scene , and yelling taunts ."
1759,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Pepper was flying at his heels , and , with great agility , was keeping out of the way of the invincible blade ."
1760,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Ah ! '' screamed the Dwarf as Pepper got him by the ankle .
1761,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Call off your dog , you coward , and come down off your horse , and fight fair ! ''"
1762,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"At this moment , bleeding yellow blood , dusty , mad with pain , the dwarf was a sight to strike terror into the boldest ."
1763,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Dick sprang from his saddle , but so terrific was the appearance of his adversary , and so dazzling was the sheen of the diamond sword , that he put his hand in his pocket , drew out , as he supposed , the sham Cap of Darkness , and placed it on his head ."
1764,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Yah ! who 's your hatter ? '' screamed the infuriated dwarf . ''
1765,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I see you ! '' and he disengaged , feinted in carte , and made a lunge in seconde at Dick which no mortal blade could have parried ."
1766,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The prince thanks to his excellent training just succeeded in stepping aside , but the dwarf recovered with astonishing quickness ."
1767,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Coward , lache , poltroon , runaway ! '' he hissed through his clenched teeth , and was about to make a thrust in tierce which must infallibly have been fatal , when the Princess Jaqueline , in her shape as a wasp , stung him fiercely on the wrist ."
1768,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"With an oath so awful that we dare not set it down , the dwarf dropped the diamond sword , sucked his injured limb , and began hopping about with pain ."
1769,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"In a moment Prince Ricardo 's foot was on the blade of the diamond sword , which he passed thrice through the body of the Yellow Dwarf ."
1770,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Squirming fearfully , the little monster expired , his last look a defiance , his latest word an insult : `` Yah !"
1771,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Gig-lamps ! ''
1772,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Prince Ricardo wiped the diamond blade clean from its yellow stains .
1773,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Princess Frutilla is avenged ! '' he cried .
1774,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then pensively looking at his fallen foe , `` Peace to his ashes , '' he said ; `` he died in harness ! ''"
1775,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Turning at the word , he observed that the two lions were stiff and dead , locked in each other 's gory jaws !"
1776,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"At that moment King Prigio , looking in the crystal ball , gave a great sigh of relief ."
1777,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` All 's well that ends well , '' he said , lighting a fresh cigar , for he had allowed the other to go out in his excitement , `` but it was a fight !"
1778,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I am not satisfied , '' his Majesty went on reflecting , `` with this plan of changing the magical articles ."
1779,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The first time was of no great importance , and I could not know that the boy would start on an expedition without giving me warning ."
1780,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But , in to-day 's affair he owes his safety entirely to himself and Pepper , '' for he had not seen the wasp ."
1781,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` The Fairy of the Desert quite baffled me : it was terrible .
1782,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I shall restore the right fairy things to-night .
1783,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"As to the Fairy of the Desert , '' he said , forgetting that his Wishing Cap was on , `` I wish she were dead ! ''"
1784,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,A hollow groan and the sound of a heavy body falling interrupted the king .
1785,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He looked all about the room , but saw nothing ."
1786,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,He was alone !
1787,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` She must have been in the room , invisible , '' said the king ; and , of course , she has died in that condition ."
1788,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` But I must find her body ! ''
1789,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The king groped about everywhere , like a blind man , and at last discovered the dead body of the wicked fairy lying on the sofa ."
1790,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He could not see it , of course , but he felt it with his hands ."
1791,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` This is very awkward , '' he remarked ."
1792,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` I can not ring for the servants and make them take her away .
1793,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,There is only one plan . ''
1794,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"So he wished she were in her family pyramid , in the Egyptian desert , and in a second the sofa was unoccupied ."
1795,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` A very dangerous and revengeful enemy is now removed from Ricardo 's path in life , '' said his Majesty , and went to dress for dinner ."
1796,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Meanwhile Ricardo was riding gaily home .
1797,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The yellow light of Jaunia had vanished , and pure blue sky broke overhead as soon as the dauntless Dwarf had drawn his latest breath ."
1798,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The poor , trembling people of the country came out of their huts and accompanied Dick , cheering , and throwing roses which had been yellow roses , but blushed red as soon as the Dwarf expired ."
1799,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"They attended him to the frontiers of Pantouflia , singing his praises , which Ricardo had the new and inestimable pleasure of knowing to be deserved ."
1800,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` It was sharp work , '' he said to himself , `` but much more exciting and glorious than the usual business . ''"
1801,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"On his return Dick did not fail to mention the wasp , and again the king felt how great was his debt to Jaqueline ."
1802,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But they did not think it well to trouble the good queen with the dangers Dick had encountered .
1803,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,-LCB- The enormous letter : p146.jpg -RCB- One morning the post brought a truly enormous letter for Dick .
1804,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"It was as broad as a table-cloth , and the address was written in letters as long as a hoop-stick ."
1805,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I seem to know that hand , '' said Ricardo ; `` but I thought the fingers which held the pen had long been cold in death . ''"
1806,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He opened , with his sword , the enormous letter , which was couched in the following terms : `` The Giant as does not know when he has had enuf , presents his compliments to Prince Ricardo ; and I , having recovered from the effects of our little recent rally , will be happy to meet you in the old place for a return-match ."
1807,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I not being handy with the pen , the Giant hopes you will excuse mistakes and bad writing . ''"
1808,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Dick simply gazed with amazement .
1809,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` If ever I thought an enemy was killed and done for , it was that Giant , '' said he ."
1810,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Why , I made mere mince-collops of him ! ''"
1811,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"However , he could not refuse a challenge , not to speak of his duty to rid the world of so greedy and odious a tyrant ."
1812,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Dick , therefore , took the usual things which the king had secretly restored , but first he tried them -- putting on the Cap of Darkness before the glass , in which he could not see himself ."
1813,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"On second thoughts , he considered it unfair to take the cap ."
1814,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,All the other articles were in working order .
1815,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Jaqueline on this occasion followed him in the disguise of a crow , flying overhead ."
1816,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"On reaching the cavern -- a huge tunnel in the rock -- where the Giant lived , Ricardo blew a blast on the horn which hung outside , and in obedience to a written notice , knocked also with a mace provided by the Giant for that purpose ."
1817,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Presently he heard heavy footsteps sounding along the cavern , and the Giant came out ."
1818,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He was above the common height for giants , and his whole face and body were seamed over with little red lines , crossing each other like tartan ."
1819,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"These were marks of encounters , in which he had been cut to bits and come together again ; for this was his peculiarity , which made him so dangerous ."
1820,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"If you cut off his head , he went on just as before , only without it ; and so about everything else ."
1821,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"By dint of magic , he could put his head on again , just as if it had been his hat , if you gave him time enough ."
1822,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"On the last occasion of their meeting , Ricardo had left him in a painfully scattered condition , and thought he was done for ."
1823,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But now , except that a bird had flown away with the little finger of his left hand and one of his ears , the Giant was as comfortable as anyone could be in his situation ."
1824,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Mornin ' sir , '' he said to Dick , touching his forehead with his hand ."
1825,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Glad to see you looking so well .
1826,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"No bad feeling , I hope , on either side ? ''"
1827,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` None on mine , certainly , '' said Ricardo , holding out his hand , which the Giant took and shook ; `` but Duty is Duty , and giants must go ."
1828,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The modern world has no room for them . ''
1829,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` That 's hearty , '' said the Giant ; `` I like a fellow of your kind ."
1830,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Now , shall we toss for corners ? ''"
1831,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` All right ! '' said Dick , calling `` Heads '' and winning ."
1832,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,He took the corner with the sun on his back and in the Giant 's face .
1833,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"To it they went , the Giant aiming a blow with his club that would have felled an elephant ."
1834,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Dick dodged , and cut off the Giant 's feet at the ankles ."
1835,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` First blood for the prince ! '' said the Giant , coming up smiling ."
1836,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Half - minute time ! ''
1837,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He occupied the half-minute in placing the feet neatly beside each other , as if they had been a pair of boots ."
1838,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Round II . -- The Giant sparring for wind , Ricardo cuts him in two at the waist ."
1839,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The Giant folded his legs up neatly , like a pair of trousers , and laid them down on a rock ."
1840,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He had now some difficulty in getting rapidly over the ground , and stood mainly on the defensive , and on his waist ."
1841,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Round III . -- Dick bisects the Giant .
1842,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Both sides now attack him on either hand , and the feet kick him severely ."
1843,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` No kicking ! '' said Dick .
1844,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Nonsense ; all fair in war ! '' said the Giant .
1845,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But do not let us pursue this sanguinary encounter in all its horrible details .
1846,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Let us also remember -- otherwise the scene would be too painful for an elegant mind to contemplate with entertainment -- that the Giant was in excellent training , and thought no more of a few wounds than you do of a crack on the leg from a cricket-ball ."
1847,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He well deserved the title given him by the Fancy , of `` The Giant who does not Know when he has had Enough . ''"
1848,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,* * * * * The contest was over ; Dick was resting on a rock .
1849,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The lists were strewn with interesting but imperfect fragments of the Giant , when a set of double teeth of enormous size flew up out of the ground and caught Ricardo by the throat !"
1850,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"In vain he strove to separate the teeth , when the crow , stooping from the heavens , became the Princess Jaqueline , and changed Dick into a wren -- a tiny bird , so small that he easily flew out of the jaws of the Giant and winged his way to a tree , whence he watched the scene ."
1851,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But the poor Princess Jaqueline !
1852,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"To perform the feat of changing Dick into a bird she had , of course , according to all the laws of magic , to resume her own natural form !"
1853,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"There she stood , a beautiful , trembling maiden , her hands crossed on her bosom , entirely at the mercy of the Giant !"
1854,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"No sooner had Dick escaped than the monster began to collect himself ; and before Jaqueline could muster strength to run away or summon to her aid the lessons of the Fairy Paribanou , the Giant who never Knew when he had Enough was himself again ."
1855,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"A boy might have climbed up a tree for giants are no tree-climbers , any more than the grizzly bear , but Jaqueline could not climb ."
1856,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She merely stood , pale and trembling ."
1857,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She had saved Dick , but at an enormous sacrifice , for the sword and the Seven - league Boots were lying on the trampled grass ."
1858,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He had not brought the Cap of Darkness , and , in the shape of a wren , of course he could not carry away the other articles ."
1859,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Dick was rescued , that was all , and the Princess Jaqueline had sacrificed herself to her love for him ."
1860,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The Giant picked himself up and pulled himself together , as we said , and then approached Jaqueline in a very civil way , for a person of his breeding , head in hand ."
1861,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Let me introduce myself , '' he said , and mentioned his name and titles ."
1862,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` May I ask what you are doing here , and how you came ? ''"
1863,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Poor Jaqueline threw herself at his feet , and murmured a short and not very intelligible account of herself ."
1864,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I don't understand , '' said the Giant , replacing his head on his shoulders ."
1865,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` What to do with you , I 'm sure I don't know . '"
1866,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Please don't eat me , ' did you say ?"
1867,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Why , what do you take me for ?"
1868,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I 'm not in that line at all ; low , I call it ! ''"
1869,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Jaqueline was somewhat comforted at these words , dropped out of the Giant 's lips from a considerable height ."
1870,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` But they call you ` The Giant who does not Know when he has had Enough , ' '' said Jaqueline ."
1871,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` And proud of the title : not enough of fighting .
1872,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Of punishment I am a glutton , or so my friends are pleased to say ."
1873,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"A brace of oxen , a drove of sheep or two , are enough for me , '' the Giant went on complacently , but forgetting to mention that the sheep and the oxen were the property of other people ."
1874,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Where am I to put you till your friends come and pay your ransom ? '' the Giant asked again , and stared at Jaqueline in a perplexed way ."
1875,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I ca n't take you home with me , that is out of the question ."
1876,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I have a little woman of my own , and she 's not very fond of other ladies ; especially , she would like to poison them that have good looks . ''"
1877,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Now Jaqueline saw that the Giant , big as he was , courageous too , was afraid of his wife !"
1878,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I 'll tell you what I 'll do ; I 'll hand you over to a neighbour of mine , who is a bachelor . ''"
1879,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` A bachelor giant ; would that be quite proper ? '' said Jaqueline , trying to humour him ."
1880,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` He 's not a giant , bless you ; he 's a queer fellow , it is not easy to say what he is ."
1881,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He 's the Earthquaker , him as shakes the earth now and then , and brings the houses about people 's ears . ''"
1882,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Jaqueline fairly screamed at hearing this awful news .
1883,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Hush ! be quiet , do ! '' said the Giant ."
1884,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` You 'll bring out my little woman , and she is not easy to satisfy with explanations when she finds me conversing with a lady unbeknown to her ."
1885,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The Earthquaker wo n't do you any harm ; it 's only for safe keeping I 'll put you with him .
1886,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Why , he don't waken , not once in fifty years ."
1887,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,He 's quite the dormouse .
1888,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Turns on his bed now and then , and things upstairs get upset , more or less ; but , as a rule , a child could play with him ."
1889,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Come on ! ''
1890,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then , taking Jaqueline up on one hand , on which she sat as if on a chair , he crossed a few ranges of mountains in as many strides ."
1891,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"In front was one tall blue hill , with a flattened peak , and as they drew near the princess felt a curious kind of wind coming round her and round her ."
1892,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"You have heard of whirlpools in water ; well , this was just like a whirlpool of air ."
1893,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Even the Giant himself could hardly keep his legs against it ; then he tossed Jaqueline up , and the airy whirlpool seized her and carried her , as if on a tide of water , always round and round in narrowing circles , till she was sucked down into the hollow hill ."
1894,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Even as she went , she seemed to remember the hill , as if she had dreamed about it , and the shape and colour of the country ."
1895,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But presently she sank softly on to a couch , in a beautifully-lighted rocky hall ."
1896,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"All around her the floor was of white and red marble , but on one side it seemed to end in black nothing ."
1897,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Jaqueline , after a few moments , recovered her senses fully , and changing herself into an eagle , tried to fly up and out ."
1898,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But as soon as she was in the funnel , the whirlpool of air always sucking down and down , was too strong for her wings ."
1899,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She was a prisoner in this great gleaming hall , ending in black nothingness ."
1900,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"So she resumed her usual form , and walking to the edge of the darkness , found that it was not empty air , but something black , soft , and strong -- something living ."
1901,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"It had no form or shape , or none that she could make out ; but it pulsed with a heart ."
1902,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Jaqueline placed her foot on this curious thing , when a voice came , like thunder heard through a feather-bed : `` Not near time to get up yet ! '' and then there was a snore , and the great hall rocked like a ship at sea ."
1903,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,It was the Earthquaker !
1904,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The habits of this monstrous animal are very little known , as , of course , he never comes above ground , or at least very seldom , when he makes tracks like a dry river-bed across country ."
1905,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"We are certain that there are Earthquakers , otherwise how can we account for earthquakes ?"
1906,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But how to tackle an Earthquaker , how to get at him , and what to do with him when you have got at him , are questions which might puzzle even King Prigio ."
1907,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,It was not easy to have the better of an enchantress like Jaqueline and a prince like Ricardo .
1908,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"In no ordinary circumstances could they have been baffled and defeated ; but now it must be admitted that they were in a very trying and alarming situation , especially the princess ."
1909,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The worst of it was , that as Jaqueline sat and thought and thought , she began to remember that she was back in her own country ."
1910,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The hills were those she used to see from her father 's palace windows when she was a child .
1911,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And she remembered with horror that once a year her people used to send a beautiful girl to the Earthquaker , by way of keeping him quiet , as you shall hear presently ."
1912,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And now she heard light footsteps and a sound of weeping , and lo ! a great troop of pretty girls passed , sweeping in and out of the halls in a kind of procession , and looking unhappy and lost ."
1913,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Jaqueline ran to them .
1914,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Where am I ? who are you ? '' she cried , in the language of her own country , which came back to her on a sudden ."
1915,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` We are nurses of the Earthquaker , '' they said ."
1916,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Our duty is to sing him asleep , and every year he must have a new song ; and every year a new maiden must be sent down from earth , with a new sleepy song she has learned from the priests of Manoa , the City of the Sun ."
1917,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Are you the new singer ? ''
1918,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` No , I 'm not , '' said Jaqueline ."
1919,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` I don't know the priests of Manoa ; I don't know any new sleepy song .
1920,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I only want to find the way out . ''
1921,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` There is no way , or we should have found it , '' said one of the maidens ; `` and , if you are the wrong girl , by the day after to-morrow they must send the right one , otherwise the Earthquaker will waken , and shake the world , and destroy Manoa , the City of the Sun . ''"
1922,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Then they all wept softly in the stillness .
1923,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Can we get anything to eat here ? '' asked poor Jaqueline , at last ."
1924,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She was beginning to be very hungry , and however alarmed she might be , she felt that dinner would not be unwelcome ."
1925,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The tallest of the maidens clapped her hands , and immediately a long table was spread by unseen sprites with meringues and cold chicken , and several sorts of delicious ices ."
1926,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"We shall desert Jaqueline , who was rather less alarmed when she found that she was not to be starved , at all events , and return to Prince Ricardo , whom we left fluttering about as a little golden-crested wren ."
1927,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He followed the Giant and Jaqueline into the whirlpool of air as far as he dared , and when he saw her vanish down the cone of the hill , he flew straight back to Pantouflia ."
1928,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"A weary and way-worn little bird was Prince Ricardo when he fluttered into the royal study window , in the palace of Pantouflia ."
1929,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The king was out at a council meeting ; knowing that Ricardo had the right things , all in good order , he was not in the least anxious about him ."
1930,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The king was out , but Semiramis was in -- Semiramis , the great grey cat , sitting on a big book on the top of the library steps ."
1931,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Now Semiramis was very fond of birds , and no sooner did Ricardo enter and flutter on to a table than Semiramis gathered herself together and made one fell spring at him ."
1932,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,She just caught his tail feather .
1933,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,In all his adventures the prince had never been in greater danger .
1934,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He escaped , but no more , and went flying round the ceiling , looking for a safe place ."
1935,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Finally he perched on a chandelier that hung from the roof .
1936,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Here he was safe ; and so weary was he , that he put his head under his wing and fell fast asleep ."
1937,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He was awakened by the return of the king , who threw himself on a sofa and exclaimed : `` Oh , that Prime Minister ! his dulness is as heavy as lead ; much heavier , in fact ! ''"
1938,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Then his Majesty lit a cigar and took up a volume ; he certainly was a sad bookworm .
1939,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Dick now began to fly about the room , brushing the king 's face and trying to attract his notice ."
1940,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Poor little thing ! '' said his Majesty .
1941,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And Dick alighted , and nestled in his breast ."
1942,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"On seeing this , Semiramis began to growl , as cats do when they are angry , and slowly approached his Majesty ."
1943,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Get out , Semiramis ! '' said the king ; and lifting her by the neck , he put her out of the room and shut the door , at which she remained scratching and mewing ."
1944,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Dick now crept out of the royal waistcoat , flew to the king 's ear , twittered , pointed out of the window with one claw , and , lying down on his back , pretended to be dead ."
1945,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then he got up again , twittered afresh , pointed to the Wishing Cap , and , finally , convinced the king that this was no common fowl ."
1946,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` An enchanted prince or princess , '' said Prigio , `` such as I have often read of ."
1947,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Who can it be ?
1948,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Not Jaqueline ; she could change herself back in a moment .
1949,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"By the way , where is Jaqueline ? ''"
1950,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He rang the bell , and asked the servant to look for the princess ."
1951,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Semiramis tried to come in , but was caught and shut up downstairs ."
1952,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"After doing this , the man replied that her Royal Highness had not been in the palace all day ."
1953,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The king rushed to the crystal ball , looked all the world over ; but no princess !"
1954,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He became very nervous , and at that moment Dick lighted on the crystal ball , and put his claw on the very hill where Jaqueline had disappeared ."
1955,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Then he cocked his little eye at the king .
1956,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Nay , she is somewhere in the unknown centre of South America , '' said his Majesty ; `` somewhere behind Mount Roraima , where nobody has ever been ."
1957,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I must look into this . ''
1958,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then he put on the Wishing Cap , and wished that the bird would assume his natural shape if he was under enchantment , as there seemed too good reason to believe ."
1959,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Instantly Dick stood before him .
1960,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Ricardo ! '' cried the king in horror ; `` and in this disguise !
1961,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Where have you been ?
1962,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,What have you done with Jaqueline ?
1963,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Where are the Seven-league Boots ?
1964,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Where is the Sword of Sharpness ?
1965,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Speak !
1966,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Get up ! '' for Dick was kneeling and weeping bitterly at the royal feet .
1967,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` All lost ! '' said Dick .
1968,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Poor Jaqueline ! she was the best girl , and the prettiest , and the kindest ."
1969,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And the Earthquaker 's got her , and the Giant 's got the other things , '' Dick ended , crying bitterly ."
1970,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Calm yourself , Ricardo , '' said his Majesty , very pale , but calm and determined ."
1971,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Here , take a glass of port , and explain how all this happened . ''"
1972,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Dick drank the wine , and then he told his miserable story ."
1973,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` You may well sob !
1974,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Why did n't you use the Cap of Darkness ?
1975,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Mere conceit !
1976,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But there is no use in crying over spilt milk .
1977,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The thing is , to rescue Jaqueline ."
1978,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,And what are we to say to your mother ? ''
1979,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` That 's the worst of it all , '' said Dick ."
1980,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Mother will break her heart . ''
1981,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I must see her at once , '' said the king , `` and break it to her . ''"
1982,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"This was a terrible task ; but the queen had such just confidence in her Prigio that she soon dried her tears , remarking that Heaven would not desert Jaqueline , and that the king would find a way out of the trouble ."
1983,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"His Majesty retired to his study , put his head in his hands , and thought and thought ."
1984,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` The thing is , of course , '' he said , `` to destroy the Earthquaker before he wakens ; but how ?"
1985,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,What can kill such a monster ?
1986,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Prodding him with the sword would only stir him up and make him more vicious .
1987,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And I know of no other beast we can set against him , as I did with the Fire-beast and the Ice-beast , when I was young ."
1988,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Oh , for an idea ! ''"
1989,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then his mind , somehow , went back to the Council and the ponderous stupidity of the Prime Minister ."
1990,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Heavier than lead , '' said the king ."
1991,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` By George !
1992,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I have a plan .
1993,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"If I could get to the place where they keep the Stupidity , I could carry away enough of it to flatten out the Earthquaker . ''"
1994,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then he remembered how , in an old Italian poem , he had read about all the strange lumber-room of odd things which is kept in the moon ."
1995,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,That is the advantage of reading : Knowledge is Power ; and you mostly get knowledge that is really worth having out of good old books which people do not usually read .
1996,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` If the Stupidity is kept in stock , up in the moon , and comes from there , falling naturally down on the earth in small quantities , I might obtain enough for my purpose , '' thought King Prigio ."
1997,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` But -- how to get to the moon ?
1998,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,There are difficulties about that . ''
1999,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But difficulties only sharpened the ingenuity of this admirable king .
2000,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` The other fellow had a Flying Horse , '' said he ."
2001,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"By `` the other fellow '' King Prigio meant an Italian knight , Astolfo , who , in old times , visited the moon , and there found and brought back the common sense of his friend , Orlando , as you may read in the poem of Ariosto ."
2002,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Now , '' reasoned King Prigio , `` if there is a Flying Horse at all , he is in the stables of the King of Delhi ."
2003,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,I must look into this . ''
2004,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Taking the magic spy-glass , the king surveyed the world from China to Peru , and , sure enough , there was the famous Flying Horse in the king 's stable at Delhi ."
2005,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Hastily the king thrust his feet into the Shoes of Swiftness -- so hastily , indeed , that , as the poet says , he `` madly crammed a left-hand foot into a right-hand shoe . ''"
2006,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But this , many people think , is a sign of good luck ; so he put the shoes on the proper feet , and in a few minutes was in the presence of the Great Mogul ."
2007,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The monarch received him with some surprise , but with stately kindness , and listened to Prigio while he explained what he wanted ."
2008,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I am only too happy to assist so adventurous a prince , '' remarked the Great Mogul ."
2009,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` This is like old times !
2010,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Every horse in my stable is at your service , but , as you say , only the Flying Horse is of any use to you in this expedition . ''"
2011,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He clapped his hands , the Grand Vizier appeared , and the king gave orders to have the Flying Horse saddled at once ."
2012,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He then presented King Prigio with a large diamond , and came down into the courtyard to see him mount ."
2013,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` He 's very fresh , '' said the groom who held the bridle ; `` has not been out of the stable for three hundred years ! ''"
2014,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Prigio sprang into the saddle among the salaams of the dusky multitude , and all the ladies of the seraglio waved their scented handkerchiefs out of the windows ."
2015,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The king , as he had been instructed , turned a knob of gold in the saddle of the Flying Horse , then kissed his hand to the ladies , and , giving the steed his head , cried , in excellent Persian : `` To the moon ! ''"
2016,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Up flew the horse with an easy action , and the king 's head nearly swam with the swiftness of the flight ."
2017,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Soon the earth below him was no bigger than a top , spinning on its own axis see Geography books for this , and , as night fell , earth was only a great red moon ."
2018,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Through the dark rode King Prigio , into the silver dawn of the moon ."
2019,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"All now became clear and silvery ; the coasts of the moon came into sight , with white seas breaking on them ; and at last the king reached the silver walls , and the gate of opal ."
2020,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Before the gate stood two beautiful ladies .
2021,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"One was fair , with yellow locks , the colour of the harvest moon ."
2022,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"She had a crown of a golden snake and white water-lilies , and her dress now shone white , now red , now golden ; and in her hand was the golden pitcher that sheds the dew , and a golden wand ."
2023,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The other lady was as dark as night -- dark eyes , dark hair ; her crown was of poppies ."
2024,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,She held the ebony Wand of Sleep .
2025,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Her dress was of the deepest blue , sown with stars ."
2026,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The king knew that they were the maidens of the bright and the dark side of the moon -- of the side you see , and of the side that no one has ever seen , except King Prigio ."
2027,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He stopped the Flying Horse by turning the other knob in the saddle , alighted , and bowed very low to each of the ladies ."
2028,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Daring mortal ! what make you here ? '' they asked .
2029,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And then the king told them about Jaqueline and the Earthquaker , and how he needed a great weight of Stupidity to flatten him out with ."
2030,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The ladies heard him in silence , and then they said : `` Follow us , '' and they flew lightly beside the Flying Horse till they had crossed all the bright side of the moon , above the silver palaces and silver seas , and reached the summit of the Mountains of the Moon which separate the bright from the dark side ."
2031,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Here I may go no further , '' said the bright lady ; `` and beyond , as you see , all is darkness and heavy sleep . ''"
2032,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then she touched Prigio with her golden wand with twisted serpents , and he became luminous , light raying out from him ; and the dark lady , too , shone like silver in the night : and on they flew , over black rocks and black rivers , till they reached a huge mountain , like a mountain of coal , many thousand feet high , for its head was lost in the blackness of darkness ."
2033,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The dark Moon-Lady struck the rock with her ebony wand , and said , `` Open ! '' and the cliffs opened like a door , and they were within the mountain ."
2034,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Here , '' said the dark lady , `` is the storehouse of all the Stupidity ; hence it descends in showers like Stardust on the earth whenever this mountain , which is a volcano , is in eruption ."
2035,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Only a little of the Stupidity reaches the earth , and that only in invisible dust ; yet you know how weighty it is , even in that form . ''"
2036,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Indeed , madam , '' said the king , `` no one knows it better than I do . ''"
2037,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Then make your choice of the best sort of Stupidity for your purpose , '' said the dark lady ."
2038,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,And in the light which flowed from their bodies King Prigio looked round at the various kinds of Solid Stupidity .
2039,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"There it all lay in masses -- the Stupidity of bad Sermons , of ignorant reviewers , of bad poems , of bad speeches , of dreary novels , of foolish statesmen , of ignorant mobs , of fine ladies , of idle , naughty boys and girls ; and the king examined them all , and all were very , very heavy ."
2040,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But when he came to the Stupidity of the Learned -- of dull , blind writers on Shakspeare , and Homer , and the Bible -- then King Prigio saw that he had found the sort he wanted , and that a very little of it would go a long way ."
2041,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He never could have got it on the saddle of the Flying Horse if the dark lady had not touched it with her ebony wand , and made it light to carry till it was wanted for his purpose ."
2042,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"When he needed it for use , he was to utter a certain spell , which she taught him , and then the lump would recover its natural weight ."
2043,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"So he easily put a great block on his saddle-bow , and he and the dark lady flew back till they reached the crest of the Mountains of the Moon ."
2044,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"There she touched him with her ebony wand , and the silver light which the bright lady had shed on him died from his face and his body , and he became like other men ."
2045,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` You see your way ? '' said the dark lady , pointing to the bright moon of earth , shining far off in the heavens ."
2046,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then he knelt down and thanked her , and she murmured strange words of blessing which he did not understand ; but her face was grave and kind , and he thought of Queen Rosalind , his wife ."
2047,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then he jumped on the Flying Horse , galloped down and down , till he reached his palace gate ; called for Ricardo , set him behind him on the saddle , and away they rode , above land and wide seas , till they saw the crest of the hollow hill , where Jaqueline was with the Earthquaker ."
2048,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Beyond it they marked the glittering spires and towers of Manoa , the City of the Sun ; and `` Thither , '' said King Prigio , who had been explaining how matters stood , to Ricardo , `` we must ride , for I believe they stand in great need of our assistance . ''"
2049,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Had we not better go to Jaqueline first , sir ? '' said Ricardo ."
2050,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` No , '' said the king ; `` I think mine is the best plan ."
2051,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Manoa , whose golden spires and pinnacles are shining below us , is the City of the Sun , which Sir Walter Raleigh and the Spaniards could never find , so that men have doubted of its existence ."
2052,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"We are needed there , to judge by that angry crowd in the marketplace ."
2053,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,How they howl ! ''
2054,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,It was on a strange sight that the king and Ricardo looked down from the Flying Horse .
2055,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Beneath them lay the City of Manoa , filling with its golden battlements and temples a hollow of the mountains ."
2056,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Here were palaces all carved over with faces of men and beasts , and with twisted patterns of serpents ."
2057,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The city walls were built of huge square stones , and among the groves towered pyramids , on which the people did service to their gods ."
2058,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"From every temple top came the roar of beaten drums , great drums of serpentskin ."
2059,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But , in the centre of the chief square of the town , was gathered a wild crowd of men in shining copper armour and helmets of gold and glittering dresses of feathers ."
2060,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Among them ran about priests with hideous masks , crying them on to besiege and break down the royal palace ."
2061,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,From the battlements of the palace the king 's guardsmen were firing arrows and throwing spears .
2062,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The mob shot arrows back , some of them tipped with lighted straw , to burn the palace down ."
2063,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But , in the very centre of the square , was a clear space of ground , on which fell the shadow of a tall column of red stone , all carved with serpents and faces of gods ."
2064,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Beside it stood a figure horrible to see : a man clothed in serpent skins , whose face was the grinning face of a skull ; but the skull was shining black and red in patches , and a long white beard flowed from beneath it ."
2065,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"This man , mounted on a kind of altar of red stone , waved his hand and yelled , and seemed to point to the shadow of the column which fell across the square ."
2066,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The people were so furious and so eager that they did not , at first , notice King Prigio as he slowly descended ."
2067,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But at last the eyes within the skull looked up and saw him , and then the man gave a great cry , rent his glittering dress of serpentskin , and held up his hands ."
2068,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then all the multitude looked up , and seeing the Flying Horse , let their weapons fall ; and the man of the skull tore it from his face , and knelt before King Prigio , with his head in the dust ."
2069,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Thou hast come , oh , Pachacamac , as is foretold in the prophecy of the Cord of the Venerable Knots !"
2070,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Thou hast come , but behold the shadow of the stone !"
2071,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Thou art too late , oh Lord of the Earth and the Sea ! ''"
2072,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then he pointed to the shadow , which , naturally , was growing shorter , as the sun drew near mid-day ."
2073,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He spoke in the language of the ancient Incas of Peru , which of course Prigio knew very well ; and he also knew that Pachacamac was the god of that people ."
2074,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I have come , '' Prigio said , with presence of mind , `` as it has been prophesied of old . ''"
2075,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Riding on a beast that flies , '' said the old priest , `` even as the oracle declared ."
2076,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Glory to Pachacamac , even though we die to-day ! ''"
2077,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` In what can I help my people ? '' said Prigio .
2078,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Thou knowest ; why should we instruct thee ?
2079,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Thou knowest that on midsummer-day , every year , before the shadow shrinks back to the base of the huaca of Manoa , we must offer a maiden to lull the Earthquaker with a new song ."
2080,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Lo , now the shadow shrinks to the foot of the huaca , and the maid is not offered !"
2081,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"For the lot fell on the daughter of thy servant the Inca , and he refuses to give her up ."
2082,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"One daughter of his , he says , has been sacrificed to the sacred birds , the Cunturs : the birds were found slain on the hill-top , no man knows how ; but the maiden vanished . ''"
2083,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Why , it must have been Jaqueline ."
2084,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I killed the birds , '' said Ricardo , in Pantouflian ."
2085,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Silence , not a word ! '' said the king , sternly ."
2086,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` And what makes you bear arms against the Inca ? '' he asked the old man .
2087,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` We would slay him and her , '' answered the priest ; `` for , when the shadow shrinks to the foot of the stone , the sun will shine straight down into the hollow hill of the Earthquaker , and he will waken and destroy Manoa and the Temples of the Sun . ''"
2088,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Then wherefore would you slay them , when you must all perish ? ''"
2089,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` The people , oh Pachacamac , would have revenge before they die . ''"
2090,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh , folly of men ! '' said the king , solemnly ; then he cried : `` Lead me to the Inca ; this day you shall not perish ."
2091,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,Is it not predicted in the Cord of the Venerable Knots that I shall slay this monster ? ''
2092,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Hasten , oh Pachacamac , for the shadow shortens ! '' said the priest ."
2093,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Lead me to the Inca , '' answered Prigio ."
2094,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"At this the people arose with a great shout , for they , too , had been kneeling ; and , sending a flag of truce before King Prigio , the priest led him into the palace ."
2095,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The ground was strewn with bodies of the slain , and through them Prigio rode slowly into the courtyard , where the Inca was sitting in the dust , weeping and throwing ashes on his long hair and his golden raiment ."
2096,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The king bade the priest remain without the palace gates ; then dismounted , and , advancing to the Inca , raised him and embraced him ."
2097,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` I come , a king to a king , '' he said ."
2098,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` My cousin , take courage ; your sorrows are ended ."
2099,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"If I do not slay the Earthquaker , sacrifice me to your gods . ''"
2100,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` The Prophecy is fulfilled , '' said the Inca , and wept for joy ."
2101,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Yet thou must hasten , for it draws near to noon . ''"
2102,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then Prigio went up to the golden battlements , and saying no word , waved his hand ."
2103,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"In a moment the square was empty , for the people rushed to give thanks in the temples ."
2104,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Wait my coming , my cousin , '' said Prigio to the Inca ; `` I shall bring you back the daughter that was lost , when I have slain your enemy . ''"
2105,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The Inca would have knelt at his feet ; but the king raised him , and bade him prepare such a feast as had never been seen in Manoa ."
2106,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` The lost are found to-day , '' he said ; `` be you ready to welcome them . ''"
2107,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then , mounting the Flying Horse , with Dick beside him , he rose towards the peak of the hill where the Earthquaker had his home ."
2108,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Already the ground was beginning to tremble ; the Earthquaker was stirring in his sleep , for the maiden of the new song had not been sent to him , and the year ended at noon , and then he would rise and ruin Manoa ."
2109,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The sun was approaching mid-day , and Prigio put spurs to the Flying Horse ."
2110,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Ten minutes more , and the sun would look straight down the crater of the hollow hill , and the Earthquaker would arouse himself when the light and the heat fell on his body ."
2111,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Already the light of the sun shone slanting half-way down the hollow cone as the whirlpool of air caught the Flying Horse , and drew him swiftly down and down to the shadowy halls ."
2112,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"There knelt and wept the nurses of the Earthquaker on the marble floor ; but Jaqueline stood a little apart , very pale , but not weeping ."
2113,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Ricardo had leaped off before the horse touched the ground , and rushed to Jaqueline , and embraced her in his arms ; and , oh ! how glad she was to see him , so that she quite forgot her danger and laughed for joy ."
2114,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Oh ! you have come , you have come ; I knew you would come ! '' she cried ."
2115,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then King Prigio advanced , the mighty weight in his hand , to the verge of the dreadful gulf of the Earthquaker ."
2116,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The dim walls grew radiant ; a long slant arm of yellow light touched the black body of the Earthquaker , and a thrill went through him , and shook the world , so that , far away , the bells rang in Pantouflia ."
2117,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"A moment more , and he would waken in his strength ; and once awake , he would shatter the city walls and ruin Manoa ."
2118,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Even now a great mass of rock fell from the roof deep down in the secret caves , and broke into flying fragments , and all the echoes roared and rang ."
2119,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,King Prigio stood with the mighty mass poised in his hands .
2120,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Die ! '' he cried ; and he uttered the words of power , the magic spell that the dark Moon Lady had taught him ."
2121,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then all its invincible natural weight came into the mass which the king held , and down it shot full on the body of the Earthquaker ; and where that had been was nothing but a vast abyss , silent , empty , and blank , and bottomless ."
2122,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Far , far below , thousands of miles below , in the very centre of the earth , lay the dead Earthquaker , crushed flat as a sheet of paper , and the sun of midsummer-day shone straight down on the dreadful chasm , and could not waken him any more for ever ."
2123,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,The king drew a long breath .
2124,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` Stupidity has saved the world , '' he said ; and , with only strength to draw back one step from the abyss , he fell down , hiding his face in his hands ."
2125,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But Jaqueline 's arms were round his neck , and the maidens brought him water from an ice-cold spring ; and soon King Prigio was himself again , and ready for anything ."
2126,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,But afterwards he used to say that the moment when the Earthquaker stirred was the most dreadful in his life .
2127,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Now , in Manoa , where all the firm foundations of the city had trembled once , when the sun just touched the Earthquaker , the people , seeing that the shadow of the sacred column had crept to its foot , and yet Manoa stood firm again , and the Temple of the Sun was not overthrown , raised such a cry that it echoed even through the halls within the hollow hill ."
2128,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Who shall describe the joy of the maidens , and how often Jaqueline and Ricardo kissed each other ?"
2129,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` You have saved me ! '' she cried to the king , throwing her arms round him again ."
2130,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` You have saved Manoa ! ''
2131,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` And you have saved the Hope of Pantouflia , not once or twice , '' said his Majesty , grandly ."
2132,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And he told Dick how much he had owed to Jaqueline , in the fight with the Yellow Dwarf , and the fight with the Giant , for he did not think it necessary to mention the affair at Rome ."
2133,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then Dick kissed Jaqueline again , and all the maidens kissed each other , and they quite cried for gladness ."
2134,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` But we keep his Majesty the Inca waiting , '' said Prigio ."
2135,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,`` Punctuality is the courtesy of kings .
2136,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"You ladies will excuse me , I am sure , if I remove first from the dungeon her whom we call the Princess Jaqueline ."
2137,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The Inca , her father , has a claim on us to this preference . ''"
2138,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then placing Jaqueline on the saddle , and leaving Dick to comfort the other young ladies , who were still rather nervous , the king flew off to Manoa , for the wind , of course , died with the death of the Earthquaker ."
2139,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"I can not tell you the delight of all Manoa , and of the Inca , when they saw the Flying Horse returning , and recognised their long-lost princess , who rushed into the arms of her father ."
2140,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"They beat the serpent drums , for they had no bells , on the tops of the temples ."
2141,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"They went quite mad with delight : enemies kissed in the streets ; and all the parents , without exception , allowed all the young people who happened to be in love to be married that very day ."
2142,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then Prigio brought back all the maidens , one after the other , and Dick last ; and he fell at the Inca 's feet , and requested leave to marry Jaqueline ."
2143,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"But , before that could be done , King Prigio , mounted on the palace balcony , made a long but very lucid speech to the assembled people ."
2144,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He began by explaining that he was not their God , Pachacamac , but king of a powerful country of which they had never heard before , as they lived very much withdrawn in an unknown region of the world ."
2145,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Then he pointed out , in the most considerate manner , that their religion was not all he could wish , otherwise they would never sacrifice young ladies to wild birds and Earthquakers ."
2146,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"He next sketched out the merits of his own creed , that of the Lutheran Church ; and the Inca straightway observed that he proposed to establish it in Manoa at once ."
2147,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Some objection was raised by the old priest in the skull mask ; but when the Inca promised to make him an archbishop , and to continue all his revenues , the priest admitted that he was perfectly satisfied ; and the general public cheered and waved their hats with emotion ."
2148,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"It was arranged that the Inca , with his other daughters , should visit Pantouflia immediately , both because he could not bear to leave Jaqueline , and also because there were a few points on which he felt that he still needed information ."
2149,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The Government was left in the hands of the archbishop , who began at once by burning his skull mask you may see one like it in the British Museum , in the Mexican room , and by letting loose all the birds and beasts which the Manoans used to worship ."
2150,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"So all the young people were married in the Golden Temple of the Sun , and all the Earthquaker 's nurses who were under thirty were wedded to the young men who had been fond of them before they were sent into the hollow hill ."
2151,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,These young men had never cared for any one else .
2152,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Everybody wore bridal favours , all the unengaged young ladies acted as bridesmaids , and such a throwing of rice and old shoes has very seldom been witnessed ."
2153,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"As for the happy royal pair , with their fathers , and the other princess who did not happen to be engaged , back they flew to Pantouflia ."
2154,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"And there was Queen Rosalind waiting at the palace gates , and crying and laughing with pleasure when she heard that the wish of her heart was fulfilled , and Jaqueline was to be her daughter ."
2155,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"`` And , as for the Earthquaker , '' said her Majesty , `` I never was really anxious in the least , for I knew no beast in the world was a match for you , my dear . ''"
2156,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"So , just to make everything orderly and correct , Ricardo and Jaqueline were married over again , in the Cathedral of Pantouflia ."
2157,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The marriage presents came in afterwards , of course , and among them , what do you think ?"
2158,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"Why , the Seven-League Boots and the Sword of Sharpness , with a very polite note of extraordinary size : `` The Giant who does not Know when he has had Enough presents his hearty congratulations to the royal pair , and begs to lay at their feet the Seven-league Boots they not fitting me and the Sword which Prince Ricardo left in the Giant 's keeping recently ."
2159,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"The Giant hopes no bad blood ; and I am , `` Yours very faithfully , `` THE G. , & c. `` P.S. -- His little woman sends her congratulations . ''"
2160,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"So you see the Giant was not such a bad sort of fellow after all , and Prince Ricardo always admitted that he never met a foe more gallant and good-humoured ."
2161,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"With such a clever wife , Ricardo easily passed all his examinations ; and his little son , Prince Prigio named after his august grandfather , never had to cry , `` Mamma , mamma , father 's plucked again . ''"
2162,Andrew Lang,Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia,,"So they lived happily in a happy country , occasionally visiting Manoa ; and as they possessed the magical Water o Life from the Fountain of Lions , I do not believe that any of them ever died at all , but that Prigio is still King of Pantouflia ."
2163,Henrique Figora,The Lonely Dinosaur,,Many years ago dinosaurs were the largest creatures on earth. 
2164,Henrique Figora,The Lonely Dinosaur,,Some were very large and others small. 
2165,Henrique Figora,The Lonely Dinosaur,,They also came in many different colors. 
2166,Henrique Figora,The Lonely Dinosaur,,Behind the fiery mountains was a valley in which the dinosaurs spent the day. 
2167,Henrique Figora,The Lonely Dinosaur,,One sunny day the dinosaurs were playing a game of soccer. 
2168,Henrique Figora,The Lonely Dinosaur,,A new dinosaur that the other dinosaurs had not seen before came walking by. 
2169,Henrique Figora,The Lonely Dinosaur,,"He stopped and watched and then he asked, ""Could I play too?"" "
2170,Henrique Figora,The Lonely Dinosaur,,All of the other dinosaurs looked at him. 
2171,Henrique Figora,The Lonely Dinosaur,,"Together in one giant voice they said, ""NO!"""
2172,Henrique Figora,The Lonely Dinosaur,,The reason they had said no to him was because he looked different than the others. 
2173,Henrique Figora,The Lonely Dinosaur,,He had a long neck and he was green. 
2174,Henrique Figora,The Lonely Dinosaur,,"None of them had ever heard of or seen a long necked, green dinosaur. "
2175,Henrique Figora,The Lonely Dinosaur,,The new dinosaur was very sad because everyone said no to him and they even called him 'Greeny'. 
2176,Henrique Figora,The Lonely Dinosaur,,His feelings were hurt. 
2177,Henrique Figora,The Lonely Dinosaur,,Slowly he sat down and sadly watched the others play.. 
2178,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,Many moons ago there was a folk tale passed down from generation to generation. 
2179,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,The story is about the Cho-Cho Man or the Boogie Man. 
2180,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,It all began with a young boy named Dakota. 
2181,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,Dakota's mother had asked him to gather some firewood for the evening fire. 
2182,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,The nights were getting cooler. 
2183,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,"Instead of doing the chore right away, Dakota figured he had enough sunlight left to do two things. "
2184,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,"He would gather the firewood after he played with his friends Morgan, Joey, and Bo. "
2185,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,"Not long after, his mother began to wonder why Dakota never came with any firewood. "
2186,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,Night had fallen fast and it was too hard to see the firewood. 
2187,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,Dakota realized what had happened. 
2188,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,He told his friends about his predicament and they said that they would help their friend. 
2189,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,"Soon after, the young boys were gathering wood in the dark. "
2190,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,Dakota's mother was worried that something had happened. 
2191,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,She went looking for Dakota. 
2192,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,"Not long after, she heard the boys. "
2193,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,She had mixed feelings. 
2194,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,She was happy to see Dakota but she was also mad that he hadn't listened to his mother. 
2195,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,She wanted to teach Dakota and his friends a lesson so she sneaked into the bush very quietly. 
2196,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,Then she picked up a twig and threw it. 
2197,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,The twig hit the ground making noise. 
2198,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,It caught the boys' attention. 
2199,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,She threw another broken twig in the opposite direction. 
2200,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,The boys jumped. 
2201,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,The mother had a hard time holding back her laughter and a muffled moan sounded through her fingers. 
2202,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,The boys were definitely scared. 
2203,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,But Dakota was the brave one. 
2204,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,He ventured forward. 
2205,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,The mother moaned again; she threw another twig. 
2206,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,The boys were transfixed. 
2207,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,"Once more the mother moaned in a low and deep voice, ""Listen to your mother."" "
2208,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,The boys dropped everything and ran. 
2209,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,"The mother could not hold back her laughter and the boys, hearing this, scurried home even faster. "
2210,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,"After the mother had picked up some firewood, she proceeded home, where she found Dakota in tears. "
2211,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,"Dakota exclaimed, ""Mother, Mother I'm sorry I didn't listen to you."" "
2212,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,His mother held him with love and she knew that he was truly sorry. 
2213,Brenda Wright,Always Listen,,"From then on when Dakota felt like not listening, the mother would mention, ""The boogie-man will scare you if you misbehave."""
2214,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,"A long time ago, in a big beautiful forest there lived many animals. "
2215,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,The animals in the forest were happy and they lived a wonderful life. 
2216,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,One reason that the animals were happy was because in the forest there also lived a little princess. 
2217,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,"The little princess had long curly, blonde hair. "
2218,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,"Do you know what her name was? It might surprise you but her name was Marina! Yes, Marina, a beautiful name for a beautiful little princess. "
2219,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,Every morning she would go to the park near the river to play with her friends. 
2220,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,"Mrs. Rabbit, Mr. Skunk and the very young deer were her best friends. "
2221,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,One day they were playing together. 
2222,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,They were having so much fun that they lost track of the time. 
2223,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,The sun went down and it became dark. 
2224,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,The little animals were afraid to go home alone. 
2225,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,Princess Marina had an idea. 
2226,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,"She said, ""Why don't you all come to my Grandpa's home with me. Grandpa doesn't mind it when I bring my friends to his place."""
2227,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,When Marina and her friends arrived at her grandpa's house her invited them in. 
2228,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,He gave them all the treats that they could eat. 
2229,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,After they ate they all played games. 
2230,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,"After a time Grandpa in a deep loud voice said, ""It's time for bed now."" "
2231,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,Grandpa gathered all the friends around and told them a bedtime story. 
2232,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,Before long everyone was fast asleep. 
2233,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,In the morning it was safe for the animals to go home. 
2234,Henrique Figora,The Forest Princess,,Everyday Marina and her friends still play but now they make sure that they go home before it gets dark.
2235,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"There was once a Miller, who, at his death, had nothing to leave to his three sons except his mill, his ass, and his cat. "
2236,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"The eldest son took the mill, the second took the ass and as for the youngest, all that remained for him was the cat. "
2237,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,The youngest son grumbled at this. 
2238,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"My brothers, said he, ""will be able to earn an honest living; but when I have eaten my cat and sold his skin I shall die of hunger."" "
2239,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"The Cat, who was sitting beside him, overheard this. "
2240,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"Nay, Master, he said, ""don't take such a gloomy view of things. If you will get me a pair of boots made so that I can walk through the brambles without hurting my feet, and give me a bag, you shall soon see what I am worth."" "
2241,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"The Cat's master was so surprised to hear his Cat talking, that he at once got him what he wanted. "
2242,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,The Cat drew on the boots and slung the bag round his neck and set off for a rabbit warren. 
2243,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"When he got there he filled his bag with bran and lettuces, and stretching himself out beside it as if dead, waited until some young rabbit should be tempted into the bag. "
2244,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,This happened very soon. 
2245,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"A fat, thoughtless rabbit went in headlong, and the Cat at once jumped up, pulled the strings and killed him. "
2246,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"Puss was very proud of his success, and, going to the King's palace, he asked to speak to the King. "
2247,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"When he was shown into the King's presence he bowed respectfully, and, laying the rabbit down before the throne, he said""Sire, here is a rabbit, which my master, the Marquis of Carabas, desires me to present to your Majesty."" "
2248,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"Tell your master, said the King, ""that I accept his present, and am very much obliged to him.""  "
2249,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"A few days later, the Cat went and hid himself in a cornfield and laid his bag open as before."
2250,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"This time two splendid partridges were lured into the trap, and these also he took to the Palace and presented to the King from the Marquis of Carabas. "
2251,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"The King was very pleased with this gift, and ordered the messenger of the Marquis of Carabas to be handsomely rewarded. "
2252,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"For two or three months the Cat went on in this way, carrying game every day to the Palace, and saying it was sent by the Marquis of Carabas. "
2253,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"At last the Cat happened to hear that the King was going to take a drive on the banks of the river, with his daughter, the most beautiful Princess in the world. "
2254,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,He at once went to his master. 
2255,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"Master, said he, ""if you follow my advice, your fortune will be made. Go and bathe in the river at a place I shall show you, and I will do the rest."" "
2256,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"Very well, said the Miller's son, and he did as the Cat told him. "
2257,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"When he was in the water, the Cat took away his clothes and hid them, and then ran to the road, just as the King's coach went by, calling out as loudly as he could""Help, help! The Marquis of Carabas will be drowned."" "
2258,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"The King looked out of the carriage window, and when he saw the Cat who had brought him so many fine rabbits and partridges, he ordered his bodyguards to fly at once to the rescue of the Marquis of Carabas. "
2259,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,Then the Cat came up to the carriage and told the King that while his master was bathing some robbers had stolen all his clothes. 
2260,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"The King immediately ordered one of his own magnificent suits of clothes to be taken to the Marquis; so when the Miller's son appeared before the monarch and his daughter, he looked so handsome, and was so splendidly attired, that the Princess fell in love with him on the spot. "
2261,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,The King was so struck with his appearance that he insisted upon his getting into the carriage to take a drive with them. 
2262,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"The Cat, delighted with the way his plans were turning out, ran on before. "
2263,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,He reached a meadow where some peasants were making hay. 
2264,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"Good people, said he, ""if you do not tell the King, when he comes this way, that the meadow you are mowing belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall all be chopped up into little pieces."" "
2265,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"When the King came by, he stopped to ask the haymakers to whom the meadow belonged. "
2266,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"To the Marquis of Carabas, if it please Your Majesty, answered they, trembling, for the Cat's threat had frightened them terribly. "
2267,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"The Cat, who continued to run before the carriage, now came to some reapers. "
2268,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"Good people, said he, ""if you do not tell the King that all this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall all be chopped up into little pieces."""
2269,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"The King again stopped to ask to whom the land belonged, and the reapers, obedient to the Cat's command, answered ""To the Marquis of Carabas, please Your Majesty."" "
2270,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"And all the way the Cat kept running on before the carriage, repeating the same instructions to all the laborers he came to; so that the King became very astonished at the vast possessions of the Marquis of Carabas. "
2271,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"At last the Cat arrived at a great castle, where an Ogre lived who was very rich, for all the lands through which the King had been riding were part of his estate. "
2272,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"The Cat knocked at the castle door, and asked to see the Ogre. "
2273,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"The Ogre received him very civilly, and asked him what he wanted. "
2274,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"If you please, sir, said the Cat, ""I have heard that you have the power of changing yourself into any sort of animal you please and I came to see if it could possibly be true."" "
2275,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"So I have, replied the Ogre, and in a moment he turned himself into a lion. "
2276,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"This gave the Cat a great fright, and he scrambled up the curtains to the ceiling. "
2277,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"Indeed, sir, he said, ""I am now quite convinced of your power to turn yourself into such a huge animal as a lion; but I do not suppose you can change yourself into a small one such as a mouse, for instance?"" "
2278,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"""Indeed, I can,"" cried the Ogre, indignantly; and in a moment the lion had vanished, while a little brown mouse frisked about the floor. "
2279,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"In less than half a second the Cat sprang down from the curtains and, pouncing upon the mouse, ate him all up before the Ogre had time to return to any other shape. "
2280,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"And when the King arrived at the castle gates, there stood the Cat upon the doorstep, bowing and saying ""Welcome to the castle of the Marquis of Carabas!"" "
2281,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"The Marquis helped the King and the Princess to alight, and the Cat led them into a great hall, where a feast had been spread for the Ogre. "
2282,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"The King was so delighted with the good looks, the charming manners, and the great wealth of the Marquis of Carabas, that he said the Marquis must marry his daughter. "
2283,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"The Marquis, of course, replied that he should be only too happy; and the very next day he and the Princess were married. "
2284,Logan Marshall,Puss in Boots,,"As for the Cat, he was given the title of Puss-in-Boots, and ever after only caught mice for his own amusement. "
2285,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"Great good luck once happened to a young woman who was living all alone in the woods with nobody near her but her little dog; for, to her surprise, she found fresh meat every morning at her door. "
2286,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"She was very curious to know who it was that supplied her, and watching one morning, just as the sun had risen, she saw a handsome young man gliding away into the forest. "
2287,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"Having seen her, he became her husband, and she had a son by him. "
2288,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"One day, not long after this, he did not return at evening, as usual, from hunting. "
2289,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"She waited till late at night, but he came no more. "
2290,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"The next day, she swung her child to sleep in its cradle, and then said to her dog, ""Take care of your brother while I am gone, and when he cries, halloo for me."" "
2291,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"The cradle was made of the finest wampum, and all its bandages and ornaments were of the same precious stuff. "
2292,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"After a short time, the woman heard the cry of the dog, and running home as fast as she could, she found her child gone, and the dog too. "
2293,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"On looking around, she saw scattered upon the ground pieces of the wampum of her child's cradle, and she knew that the dog had been faithful, and had striven his best to save her child from being carried off, as he had been, by an old woman, from a distant country, called Mukakee Mindemoea, or the Toad-Woman. "
2294,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"The mother hurried off at full speed in pursuit, and as she flew along, she came, from time to time, to lodges inhabited by old women, who told her at what time the child-thief had passed; they also gave her shoes that she might follow on. "
2295,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"There was a number of these old women who seemed as if they were prophetesses, and knew what was to come long beforehand. "
2296,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"Each of them would say to her that when she had arrived at the next lodge, she must set the toes of the moccasins they had given her pointing homeward, and that they would return of themselves. "
2297,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,The young woman was very careful to send back in this manner all the shoes she borrowed. 
2298,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"She thus followed in the pursuit, from valley to valley, and stream to stream, for many months and years; when she came at length to the lodge of the last of the friendly old grandmothers, as they were called, who gave her the last instructions how to proceed. "
2299,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"She told her that she was near the place where her son was to be found; and she directed her to build a lodge of cedar-boughs, hard by the old Toad-Woman's lodge, and to make a little bark dish, and to fill it with the juice of the wild grape. "
2300,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"Then, she said, ""your first child (meaning the dog) will come and find you out."" "
2301,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"These directions the young woman followed just as they had been given to her, and in a short time she heard her son, now grown up, going out to hunt, with his dog, calling out to him, ""Peewaubik Spirit-Iron Twee! Twee!"" "
2302,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"The dog soon came into the lodge, and she set before him the dish of grape-juice. "
2303,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"See, my child, she said, addressing him, ""the pretty drink your mother gives you."" "
2304,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"Spirit-Iron took a long draught, and immediately left the lodge with his eyes wide open; for it was the drink which teaches one to see the truth of things as they are. "
2305,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"He rose up when he got into the open air, stood upon his hind legs, and looked about. "
2306,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"I see how it is, he said; and marching off, erect like a man, he sought out his young master. "
2307,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"Approaching him in great confidence, he bent down and whispered in his ear (having first looked cautiously around to see that no one was listening), ""This old woman here in the lodge is no mother of yours."""
2308,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"I have found your real mother, and she is worth looking at. "
2309,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"When we come back from our day's sport, I'll prove it to you."
2310,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"They went out into the woods, and at the close of the afternoon they brought back a great spoil of meat of all kinds. "
2311,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"The young man, as soon as he had laid aside his weapons, said to the old Toad-Woman, ""Send some of the best of this meat to the stranger who has arrived lately."" "
2312,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"The Toad-Woman answered, ""No! Why should I send to her, the poor widow!"" "
2313,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,The young man would not be refused; and at last the old Toad-Woman consented to take something and throw it down at the door. 
2314,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"She called out, ""My son gives you this."" "
2315,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"But, being bewitched by Mukakee Mindemoea, it was so bitter and distasteful, that the young woman immediately cast it out of the lodge after her. "
2316,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,In the evening the young man paid the stranger a visit at her lodge of cedar-boughs. 
2317,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"She then told him that she was his real mother, and that he had been stolen away from her by the old Toad-Woman, who was a child-thief and a witch. "
2318,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"As the young man appeared to doubt, she added, ""Feign yourself sick when you go home to her lodge; and when the Toad-Woman asks what ails you, say that you wish to see your cradle; for your cradle was of wampum, and your faithful brother the dog, in striving to save you, tore off these pieces which I show you."" "
2319,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"They were real wampum, white and blue, shining and beautiful; and the young man, placing them in his bosom, set off; but as he did not seem quite steady in his belief of the strange woman's story, the dog Spirit-Iron, taking his arm, kept close by his side, and gave him many words of encouragement as they went along. "
2320,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"They entered the lodge together; and the old Toad-Woman saw, from something in the dog's eye, that trouble was coming. "
2321,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"Mother, said the young man, placing his hand to his head, and leaning heavily upon Spirit-Iron, as if a sudden faintness had come upon him, ""why am I so different in looks from the rest of your children?"" "
2322,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"Oh, she answered, ""it was a very bright, clear blue sky when you were born; that is the reason."""
2323,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,He seemed to be so very ill that the Toad-Woman at length asked what she could do for him. 
2324,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,He said nothing could do him good but the sight of his cradle. 
2325,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"She ran immediately and brought a cedar cradle; but he said: ""That is not my cradle."" "
2326,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"She went and got another of her own children's cradles, of which there were four; but he turned his head, and said: ""That is not mine; I am as sick as ever."" "
2327,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"When she had shown the four, and they had been all rejected, she at last produced the real cradle. "
2328,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,The young man saw that it was of the same stuff as the wampum which he had in his bosom. 
2329,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"He could even see the marks of the teeth of Spirit-Iron left upon the edges, where he had taken hold, striving to hold it back. "
2330,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"He had no doubt, now, which was his mother. "
2331,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"To get free of the old Toad-Woman, it was necessary that the young man should kill a fat bear; and, being directed by Spirit-Iron, who was very wise in such a matter, he secured the fattest in all that country; and having stripped a tall pine of all its bark and branches, he perched the carcass in the top, with its head to the east and its tail due west. "
2332,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"Returning to the lodge, he informed the old Toad-Woman that the fat bear was ready for her, but that she would have to go very far, even to the end of the earth, to get it. "
2333,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"She answered: ""It is not so far but that I can get it;"" for of all things in the world, a fat bear was the delight of the old Toad-Woman. "
2334,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"She at once set forth; and she was no sooner out of sight than the young man and his dog, Spirit-Iron, blowing a strong breath in the face of the Toad-Woman's four children (who were all bad spirits, or bear-fiends), they put out their life. "
2335,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"They then set them up by the side of the door, having first thrust a piece of the white fat in each of their mouths. "
2336,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"The Toad-Woman spent a long time in finding the bear which she had been sent after, and she made at least five and twenty attempts before she was able to climb to the carcass. "
2337,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,She slipped down three times where she went up once. 
2338,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"When she returned with the great bear on her back, as she drew near her lodge she was astonished to see the four children standing up by the door-posts with the fat in their mouths. "
2339,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"She was angry with them, and called out: ""Why do you thus insult the pomatum of your brother?"" "
2340,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"She was still more angry when they made no answer to her complaint; but when she found that they were stark dead, and placed in this way to mock her, her fury was very great indeed. "
2341,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"She ran after the tracks of the young man and his mother as fast as she could; so fast, indeed, that she was on the very point of overtaking them, when the dog, Spirit-Iron, coming close up to his master, whispered to him ""Snakeberry!"" "
2342,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"Let the snakeberry spring up to detain her! cried out the young man; and immediately the berries spread like scarlet all over the path, for a long distance; and the old Toad-Woman, who was almost as fond of these berries as she was of fat bears, could not avoid stooping down to pick and eat. "
2343,Cornelius Mathews,The Toad-Woman,,"The old Toad-Woman was very anxious to get forward, but the snakeberry-vines kept spreading out on every side; and they still grow and grow, and spread and spread; and to this day the wicked old Toad-Woman is busy picking the berries, and she will never be able to get beyond to the other side, to disturb the happiness of the young hunter and his mother, who still live, with their faithful dog, in the shadow of the beautiful wood-side where they were born."
2344,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Marjorie sat on the door-step , shelling peas , quite unconscious what a pretty picture she made , with the roses peeping at her through the lattice work of the porch , the wind playing hide-and-seek in her curly hair , while the sunshine with its silent magic changed her faded gingham to a golden gown , and shimmered on the bright tin pan as if it were a silver shield ."
2345,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Old Rover lay at her feet , the white kitten purred on her shoulder , and friendly robins hopped about her in the grass , chirping `` A happy birthday , Marjorie ! ''"
2346,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"But the little maid neither saw nor heard , for her eyes were fixed on the green pods , and her thoughts were far away ."
2347,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"She was recalling the fairy-tale granny told her last night , and wishing with all her heart that such things happened nowadays ."
2348,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"For in this story , as a poor girl like herself sat spinning before the door , a Brownie came by , and gave the child a good-luck penny ; then a fairy passed , and left a talisman which would keep her always happy ; and last of all , the prince rolled up in his chariot , and took her away to reign with him over a lovely kingdom , as a reward for her many kindnesses to others ."
2349,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"When Marjorie imagined this part of the story , it was impossible to help giving one little sigh , and for a minute she forgot her work , so busy was she thinking what beautiful presents she would give to all the poor children in her realm when THEY had birthdays ."
2350,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Five impatient young peas took this opportunity to escape from the half-open pod in her hand and skip down the steps , to be immediately gobbled up by an audacious robin , who gave thanks in such a shrill chirp that Marjorie woke up , laughed , and fell to work again ."
2351,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"She was just finishing , when a voice called out from the lane , -- `` Hi , there ! come here a minute , child ! '' and looking up , she saw a little old man in a queer little carriage drawn by a fat little pony ."
2352,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Running down to the gate , Marjorie dropped a curtsy , saying pleasantly , -- `` What did you wish , sir ? ''"
2353,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Just undo that check-rein for me . I am lame , and Jack wants to drink at your brook , '' answered the old man , nodding at her till his spectacles danced on his nose ."
2354,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Marjorie was rather afraid of the fat pony , who tossed his head , whisked his tail , and stamped his feet as if he was of a peppery temper ."
2355,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"But she liked to be useful , and just then felt as if there were few things she could NOT do if she tried , because it was her birthday ."
2356,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"So she proudly let down the rein , and when Jack went splashing into the brook , she stood on the bridge , waiting to check him up again after he had drunk his fill of the clear , cool water ."
2357,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"The old gentleman sat in his place , looking up at the little girl , who was smiling to herself as she watched the blue dragon-flies dance among the ferns , a blackbird tilt on the alderboughs , and listened to the babble of the brook ."
2358,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` How old are you , child ? '' asked the old man , as if he rather envied this rosy creature her youth and health ."
2359,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Twelve to-day , sir ; '' and Marjorie stood up straight and tall , as if mindful of her years ."
2360,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Had any presents ? '' asked the old man , peering up with an odd smile ."
2361,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` One , sir , -- here it is ; '' and she pulled out of her pocket a tin savings-bank in the shape of a desirable family mansion , painted red , with a green door and black chimney ."
2362,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Proudly displaying it on the rude railing of the bridge , she added , with a happy face , -- `` Granny gave it to me , and all the money in it is going to be mine . ''"
2363,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` How much have you got ? '' asked the old gentleman , who appeared to like to sit there in the middle of the brook , while Jack bathed his feet and leisurely gurgled and sneezed ."
2364,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Not a penny yet , but I 'm going to earn some , '' answered Marjorie , patting the little bank with an air of resolution pretty to see ."
2365,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,`` How will you do it ? '' continued the inquisitive old man .
2366,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Oh , I 'm going to pick berries and dig dandelions , and weed , and drive cows , and do chores ."
2367,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"It is vacation , and I can work all the time , and earn ever so much . ''"
2368,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` But vacation is play-time , -- how about that ? ''"
2369,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Why , that sort of work IS play , and I get bits of fun all along ."
2370,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I always have a good swing when I go for the cows , and pick flowers with the dandelions ."
2371,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Weeding is n't so nice , but berrying is very pleasant , and we have good times all together . ''"
2372,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,`` What shall you do with your money when you get it ? ''
2373,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Oh , lots of things !"
2374,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Buy books and clothes for school , and , if I get a great deal , give some to granny ."
2375,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I 'd love to do that , for she takes care of me , and I 'd be so proud to help her ! ''"
2376,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Good little lass ! '' said the old gentleman , as he put his hand in his pocket ."
2377,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Would you now ? '' he added , apparently addressing himself to a large frog who sat upon a stone , looking so wise and grandfatherly that it really did seem quite proper to consult him ."
2378,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"At all events , he gave his opinion in the most decided manner , for , with a loud croak , he turned an undignified somersault into the brook , splashing up the water at a great rate ."
2379,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Well , perhaps it would n't be best on the whole ."
2380,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Industry is a good teacher , and money can not buy happiness , as I know to my sorrow . ''"
2381,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"The old gentleman still seemed to be talking to the frog , and as he spoke he took his hand out of his pocket with less in it than he had at first intended ."
2382,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` What a very queer person ! '' thought Marjorie , for she had not heard a word , and wondered what he was thinking about down there ."
2383,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Jack walked out of the brook just then , and she ran to check him up ; not an easy task for little hands , as he preferred to nibble the grass on the bank ."
2384,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"But she did it cleverly , smoothed the ruffled mane , and , dropping another curtsy , stood aside to let the little carriage pass ."
2385,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Thank you , child -- thank you ."
2386,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Here is something for your bank , and good luck to it . ''"
2387,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"As he spoke , the old man laid a bright gold dollar in her hand , patted the rosy cheek , and vanished in a cloud of dust , leaving Marjorie so astonished at the grandeur of the gift , that she stood looking at it as if it had been a fortune ."
2388,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"It was to her ; and visions of pink calico gowns , new grammars , and fresh hat-ribbons danced through her head in delightful confusion , as her eyes rested on the shining coin in her palm ."
2389,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Then , with a solemn air , she invested her first money by popping it down the chimney of the scarlet mansion , and peeping in with one eye to see if it landed safely on the ground-floor ."
2390,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"This done , she took a long breath , and looked over the railing , to be sure it was not all a dream ."
2391,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"No ; the wheel marks were still there , the brown water was not yet clear , and , if a witness was needed , there sat the big frog again , looking so like the old gentleman , with his bottle-green coat , speckled trousers , and twinkling eyes , that Marjorie burst out laughing , and clapped her hands , saying aloud , -- `` I 'll play he was the Brownie , and this is the good-luck penny he gave me ."
2392,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Oh , what fun ! '' and away she skipped , rattling the dear new bank like a castanet ."
2393,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"When she had told granny all about it , she got knife and basket , and went out to dig dandelions ; for the desire to increase her fortune was so strong , she could not rest a minute ."
2394,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Up and down she went , so busily peering and digging , that she never lifted up her eyes till something like a great white bird skimmed by so low she could not help seeing it ."
2395,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"A pleasant laugh sounded behind her as she started up , and , looking round , she nearly sat down again in sheer surprise , for there close by was a slender little lady , comfortably established under a big umbrella ."
2396,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` If there WERE any fairies , I 'd be sure that was one , '' thought Marjorie , staring with all her might , for her mind was still full of the old story ; and curious things do happen on birthdays , as every one knows ."
2397,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"It really did seem rather elfish to look up suddenly and see a lovely lady all in white , with shining hair and a wand in her hand , sitting under what looked very like a large yellow mushroom in the middle of a meadow , where , till now , nothing but cows and grasshoppers had been seen ."
2398,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Before Marjorie could decide the question , the pleasant laugh came again , and the stranger said , pointing to the white thing that was still fluttering over the grass like a little cloud , -- `` Would you kindly catch my hat for me , before it blows quite away ? ''"
2399,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Down went basket and knife , and away ran Marjorie , entirely satisfied now that there was no magic about the new-comer ; for if she had been an elf , could n't she have got her hat without any help from a mortal child ?"
2400,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Presently , however , it did begin to seem as if that hat was bewitched , for it led the nimble-footed Marjorie such a chase that the cows stopped feeding to look on in placid wonder ; the grasshoppers vainly tried to keep up , and every ox-eye daisy did its best to catch the runaway , but failed entirely , for the wind liked a game of romps , and had it that day ."
2401,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"As she ran , Marjorie heard the lady singing , like the princess in the story of the Goose-Girl , -- `` Blow , breezes , blow !"
2402,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Let Curdkin 's hat go !
2403,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Blow , breezes , blow !"
2404,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Let him after it go !
2405,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"O'er hills , dales and rocks , Away be it whirled , Till the silvery locks Are all combed and curled . ''"
2406,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"This made her laugh so that she tumbled into a clover-bed , and lay there a minute to get her breath ."
2407,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Just then , as if the playful wind repented of its frolic , the long veil fastened to the hat caught in a blackberry-vine near by , and held the truant fast till Marjorie secured it ."
2408,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Now come and see what I am doing , '' said the lady , when she had thanked the child ."
2409,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Marjorie drew near confidingly , and looked down at the wide-spread book before her ."
2410,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"She gave a start , and laughed out with surprise and delight ; for there was a lovely picture of her own little home , and her own little self on the door-step , all so delicate , and beautiful , and true , it seemed as if done by magic ."
2411,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Oh , how pretty !"
2412,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"There is Rover , and Kitty and the robins , and me !"
2413,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"How could you ever do it , ma'am ? '' said Marjorie , with a wondering glance at the long paint-brush , which had wrought what seemed a miracle to her childish eyes ."
2414,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` I 'll show you presently ; but tell me , first , if it looks quite right and natural to you ."
2415,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Children sometimes spy out faults that no one else can see , '' answered the lady , evidently pleased with the artless praise her work received ."
2416,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` It looks just like our house , only more beautiful ."
2417,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Perhaps that is because I know how shabby it really is .
2418,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"That moss looks lovely on the shingles , but the roof leaks ."
2419,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"The porch is broken , only the roses hide the place ; and my gown is all faded , though it once was as bright as you have made it ."
2420,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I wish the house and everything would stay pretty forever , as they will in the picture . ''"
2421,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"While Marjorie spoke , the lady had been adding more color to the sketch , and when she looked up , something warmer and brighter than sunshine shone in her face , as she said , so cheerily , it was like a bird 's song to hear her , -- `` It ca n't be summer always , dear , but we can make fair weather for ourselves if we try ."
2422,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"The moss , the roses , and soft shadows show the little house and the little girl at their best , and that is what we all should do ; for it is amazing how lovely common things become , if one only knows how to look at them . ''"
2423,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` I wish I did , '' said Marjorie , half to herself , remembering how often she was discontented , and how hard it was to get on , sometimes ."
2424,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` So do I , '' said the lady , in her happy voice ."
2425,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Just believe that there is a sunny side to everything , and try to find it , and you will be surprised to see how bright the world will seem , and how cheerful you will be able to keep your little self . ''"
2426,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` I guess granny has found that out , for she never frets ."
2427,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I do , but I 'm going to stop it , because I 'm twelve to-day , and that is too old for such things , '' said Marjorie , recollecting the good resolutions she had made that morning when she woke ."
2428,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` I am twice twelve , and not entirely cured yet ; but I try , and do n't mean to wear blue spectacles if I can help it , '' answered the lady , laughing so blithely that Marjorie was sure she would not have to try much longer ."
2429,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Birthdays were made for presents , and I should like to give you one ."
2430,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Would it please you to have this little picture ? '' she added , lifting it out of the book ."
2431,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,`` Truly my own ?
2432,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Oh , yes , indeed ! '' cried Marjorie , coloring with pleasure , for she had never owned so beautiful a thing before ."
2433,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Then you shall have it , dear ."
2434,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Hang it where you can see it often , and when you look , remember that it is the sunny side of home , and help to keep it so . ''"
2435,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Marjorie had nothing but a kiss to offer by way of thanks , as the lovely sketch was put into her hand ; but the giver seemed quite satisfied , for it was a very grateful little kiss ."
2436,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Then the child took up her basket and went away , not dancing and singing now , but slowly and silently ; for this gift made her thoughtful as well as glad ."
2437,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"As she climbed the wall , she looked back to nod good-by to the pretty lady ; but the meadow was empty , and all she saw was the grass blowing in the wind ."
2438,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Now , deary , run out and play , for birthdays come but once a year , and we must make them as merry as we can , '' said granny , as she settled herself for her afternoon nap , when the Saturday cleaning was all done , and the little house as neat as wax ."
2439,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"So Marjorie put on a white apron in honor of the occasion , and , taking Kitty in her arms , went out to enjoy herself ."
2440,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Three swings on the gate seemed to be a good way of beginning the festivities ; but she only got two , for when the gate creaked back the second time , it stayed shut , and Marjorie hung over the pickets , arrested by the sound of music ."
2441,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` It 's soldiers , '' she said , as the fife and drum drew nearer , and flags were seen waving over the barberry-bushes at the corner ."
2442,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` No ; it 's a picnic , '' she added in a moment ; for she saw hats with wreaths about them bobbing up and down , as a gayly-trimmed hay-cart full of children came rumbling down the lane ."
2443,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` What a nice time they are going to have ! '' thought Marjorie , sadly contrasting that merry-making with the quiet party she was having all by herself ."
2444,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Suddenly her face shone , and Kitty was waved over her head like a banner , as she flew out of the gate , crying , rapturously , -- `` It 's Billy ! and I know he 's come for me ! ''"
2445,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"It certainly WAS Billy , proudly driving the old horse , and beaming at his little friend from the bower of flags and chestnut-boughs , where he sat in state , with a crown of daisies on his sailor-hat and a spray of blooming sweetbrier in his hand ."
2446,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Waving his rustic sceptre , he led off the shout of `` Happy birthday , Marjorie ! '' which was set up as the wagon stopped at the gate , and the green boughs suddenly blossomed with familiar faces , all smiling on the little damsel , who stood in the lane quite overpowered with delight ."
2447,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` It 's a s ` prise party ! '' cried one small lad , tumbling out behind ."
2448,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` We are going up the mountain to have fun ! '' added a chorus of voices , as a dozen hands beckoned wildly ."
2449,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` We got it up on purpose for you , so tie your hat and come away , '' said a pretty girl , leaning down to kiss Marjorie , who had dropped Kitty , and stood ready for any splendid enterprise ."
2450,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"A word to granny , and away went the happy child , sitting up beside Billy , under the flags that waved over a happier load than any royal chariot ever bore ."
2451,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"It would be vain to try and tell all the plays and pleasures of happy children on a Saturday afternoon , but we may briefly say that Marjorie found a mossy stone all ready for her throne , and Billy crowned her with a garland like his own ."
2452,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"That a fine banquet was spread , and eaten with a relish many a Lord Mayor 's feast has lacked ."
2453,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Then how the whole court danced and played together afterward !
2454,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"The lords climbed trees and turned somersaults , the ladies gathered flowers and told secrets under the sweetfern-bushes , the queen lost her shoe jumping over the waterfall , and the king paddled into the pool below and rescued it ."
2455,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"A happy little kingdom , full of summer sunshine , innocent delights , and loyal hearts ; for love ruled , and the only war that disturbed the peaceful land was waged by the mosquitoes as night came on ."
2456,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Marjorie stood on her throne watching the sunset while her maids of honor packed up the remains of the banquet , and her knights prepared the chariot ."
2457,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"All the sky was gold and purple , all the world bathed in a soft , red light , and the little girl was very happy as she looked down at the subjects who had served her so faithfully that day ."
2458,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Have you had a good time , Marjy ? '' asked King William ; who stood below , with his royal nose on a level with her majesty 's two dusty little shoes ."
2459,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Oh , Billy , it has been just splendid !"
2460,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"But I do n't see why you should all be so kind to me , '' answered Marjorie , with such a look of innocent wonder , that Billy laughed to see it ."
2461,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Because you are so sweet and good , we ca n't help loving you , -- that 's why , '' he said , as if this simple fact was reason enough ."
2462,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` I 'm going to be the best girl that ever was , and love everybody in the world , '' cried the child , stretching out her arms as if ready , in the fulness of her happy heart , to embrace all creation ."
2463,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Do n't turn into an angel and fly away just yet , but come home , or granny will never lend you to us any more . ''"
2464,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"With that , Billy jumped her down , and away they ran , to ride gayly back through the twilight , singing like a flock of nightingales ."
2465,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"As she went to bed that night , Marjorie looked at the red bank , the pretty picture , and the daisy crown , saying to herself , -- `` It has been a VERY nice birthday , and I am something like the girl in the story , after all , for the old man gave me a good-luck penny , the kind lady told me how to keep happy , and Billy came for me like the prince ."
2466,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"The girl did n't go back to the poor house again , but I 'm glad I did , for MY granny is n't a cross one , and my little home is the dearest in the world . ''"
2467,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Then she tied her night-cap , said her prayers , and fell asleep ; but the moon , looking in to kiss the blooming face upon the pillow , knew that three good spirits had come to help little Marjorie from that day forth , and their names were Industry , Cheerfulness , and Love ."
2468,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"It was a cold November storm , and everything looked forlorn ."
2469,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Even the pert sparrows were draggle-tailed and too much out of spirits to fight for crumbs with the fat pigeons who tripped through the mud with their little red boots as if in haste to get back to their cosy home in the dove-cot .
2470,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"But the most forlorn creature out that day was a small errand girl , with a bonnet-box on each arm , and both hands struggling to hold a big broken umbrella ."
2471,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,A pair of worn-out boots let in the wet upon her tired feet ; a thin cotton dress and an old shawl poorly protected her from the storm ; and a faded hood covered her head .
2472,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"The face that looked out from this hood was too pale and anxious for one so young ; and when a sudden gust turned the old umbrella inside out with a crash , despair fell upon poor Lizzie , and she was so miserable she could have sat down in the rain and cried ."
2473,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"But there was no time for tears ; so , dragging the dilapidated umbrella along , she spread her shawl over the bonnet-boxes and hurried down the broad street , eager to hide her misfortunes from a pretty young girl who stood at a window laughing at her ."
2474,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"She could not find the number of the house where one of the fine hats was to be left ; and after hunting all down one side of the street , she crossed over , and came at last to the very house where the pretty girl lived ."
2475,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"She was no longer to be seen ; and , with a sigh of relief , Lizzie rang the bell , and was told to wait in the hall while Miss Belle tried the hat on ."
2476,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Glad to rest , she warmed her feet , righted her umbrella , and then sat looking about her with eyes quick to see the beauty and the comfort that made the place so homelike and delightful ."
2477,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"A small waiting-room opened from the hall , and in it stood many blooming plants , whose fragrance attracted Lizzie as irresistibly as if she had been a butterfly or bee ."
2478,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Slipping in , she stood enjoying the lovely colors , sweet odors , and delicate shapes of these household spirits ; for Lizzie loved flowers passionately ; and just then they possessed a peculiar charm for her ."
2479,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"One particularly captivating little rose won her heart , and made her long for it with a longing that became a temptation too strong to resist ."
2480,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"It was so perfect ; so like a rosy face smiling out from the green leaves , that Lizzie could NOT keep her hands off it , and having smelt , touched , and kissed it , she suddenly broke the stem and hid it in her pocket ."
2481,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Then , frightened at what she had done , she crept back to her place in the hall , and sat there , burdened with remorse ."
2482,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"A servant came just then to lead her upstairs ; for Miss Belle wished the hat altered , and must give directions ."
2483,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"With her heart in a flutter , and pinker roses in her cheeks than the one in her pocket , Lizzie followed to a handsome room , where a pretty girl stood before a long mirror with the hat in her hand ."
2484,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Tell Madame Tifany that I do n't like it at all , for she has n't put in the blue plume mamma ordered ; and I wo n't have rose-buds , they are so common , '' said the young lady , in a dissatisfied tone , as she twirled the hat about ."
2485,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Yes , miss , '' was all Lizzie could say ; for SHE considered that hat the loveliest thing a girl could possibly own ."
2486,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` You had better ask your mamma about it , Miss Belle , before you give any orders ."
2487,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"She will be up in a few moments , and the girl can wait , '' put in a maid , who was sewing in the ante-room ."
2488,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` I suppose I must ; but I WO N'T have roses , '' answered Belle , crossly ."
2489,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Then she glanced at Lizzie , and said more gently , `` You look very cold ; come and sit by the fire while you wait . ''"
2490,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` I 'm afraid I 'll wet the pretty rug , miss ; my feet are sopping , '' said Lizzie , gratefully , but timidly ."
2491,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,`` So they are !
2492,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Why did n't you wear rubber boots ? ''
2493,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,`` I have n't got any . ''
2494,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` I 'll give you mine , then , for I hate them ; and as I never go out in wet weather , they are of no earthly use to me ."
2495,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Marie , bring them here ; I shall be glad to get rid of them , and I 'm sure they 'll be useful to you . ''"
2496,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Oh , thank you , miss !"
2497,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I 'd like 'em ever so much , for I 'm out in the rain half the time , and get bad colds because my boots are old , '' said Lizzie , smiling brightly at the thought of the welcome gift ."
2498,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` I should think your mother would get you warmer things , '' began Belle , who found something rather interesting in the shabby girl , with shy bright eyes , and curly hair bursting out of the old hood ."
2499,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` I have n't got any mother , '' said Lizzie , with a pathetic glance at her poor clothes ."
2500,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,`` I 'm so sorry !
2501,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Have you brothers and sisters ? '' asked Belle , hoping to find something pleasant to talk about ; for she was a kind little soul ."
2502,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` No , miss ; I 've got no folks at all . ''"
2503,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Oh , dear ; how sad !"
2504,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Why , who takes care of you ? '' cried Belle , looking quite distressed ."
2505,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,`` No one ; I take care of myself .
2506,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I work for Madame , and she pays me a dollar a week ."
2507,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I stay with Mrs. Brown , and chore round to pay for my keep ."
2508,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"My dollar do n't get many clothes , so I ca n't be as neat as I 'd like . ''"
2509,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,And the forlorn look came back to poor Lizzie 's face .
2510,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Belle said nothing , but sat among the sofa cushions , where she had thrown herself , looking soberly at this other girl , no older than she was , who took care of herself and was all alone in the world ."
2511,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"It was a new idea to Belle , who was loved and petted as an only child is apt to be ."
2512,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"She often saw beggars and pitied them , but knew very little about their wants and lives ; so it was like turning a new page in her happy life to be brought so near to poverty as this chance meeting with the milliner 's girl ."
2513,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Are n't you afraid and lonely and unhappy ? '' she said , slowly , trying to understand and put herself in Lizzie 's place ."
2514,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,`` Yes ; but it 's no use .
2515,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I ca n't help it , and may be things will get better by and by , and I 'll have my wish , '' answered Lizzie , more hopefully , because Belle 's pity warmed her heart and made her troubles seem lighter ."
2516,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` What is your wish ? '' asked Belle , hoping mamma would n't come just yet , for she was getting interested in the stranger ."
2517,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` To have a nice little room , and make flowers , like a French girl I know ."
2518,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"It 's such pretty work , and she gets lots of money , for every one likes her flowers ."
2519,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"She shows me how , sometimes , and I can do leaves first-rate ; but -- '' There Lizzie stopped suddenly , and the color rushed up to her forehead ; for she remembered the little rose in her pocket and it weighed upon her conscience like a stone ."
2520,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Before Belle could ask what was the matter , Marie came in with a tray of cake and fruit , saying : `` Here 's your lunch , Miss Belle . ''"
2521,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Put it down , please ; I 'm not ready for it yet . ''"
2522,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"And Belle shook her head as she glanced at Lizzie , who was staring hard at the fire with such a troubled face that Belle could not bear to see it ."
2523,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Jumping out of her nest of cushions , she heaped a plate with good things , and going to Lizzie , offered it , saying , with a gentle courtesy that made the act doubly sweet : `` Please have some ; you must be tired of waiting . ''"
2524,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,But Lizzie could not take it ; she could only cover her face and cry ; for this kindness rent her heart and made the stolen flower a burden too heavy to be borne .
2525,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Oh , do n't cry so !"
2526,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Are you sick ?
2527,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Have I been rude ?
2528,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Tell me all about it ; and if I ca n't do anything , mamma can , '' said Belle , surprised and troubled ."
2529,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` No ; I 'm not sick ; I 'm bad , and I ca n't bear it when you are so good to me , '' sobbed Lizzie , quite overcome with penitence ; and taking out the crumpled rose , she confessed her fault with many tears ."
2530,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Do n't feel so much about such a little thing as that , '' began Belle , warmly ; then checked herself , and added , more soberly , `` It WAS wrong to take it without leave ; but it 's all right now , and I 'll give you as many roses as you want , for I know you are a good girl . ''"
2531,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,`` Thank you .
2532,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I did n't want it only because it was pretty , but I wanted to copy it ."
2533,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I ca n't get any for myself , and so I ca n't do my make-believe ones well ."
2534,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Madame wo n't even lend me the old ones in the store , and Estelle has none to spare for me , because I ca n't pay her for teaching me ."
2535,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"She gives me bits of muslin and wire and things , and shows me now and then ."
2536,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"But I know if I had a real flower I could copy it ; so she 'd see I did know something , for I try real hard ."
2537,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I 'm SO tired of slopping round the streets , I 'd do anything to earn my living some other way . ''"
2538,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Lizzie had poured out her trouble rapidly ; and the little story was quite affecting when one saw the tears on her cheeks , the poor clothes , and the thin hands that held the stolen rose ."
2539,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Belle was much touched , and , in her impetuous way , set about mending matters as fast as possible ."
2540,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,`` Put on those boots and that pair of dry stockings right away .
2541,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Then tuck as much cake and fruit into your pocket as it will hold .
2542,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I 'm going to get you some flowers , and see if mamma is too busy to attend to me . ''"
2543,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"With a nod and a smile , Belle flew about the room a minute ; then vanished , leaving Lizzie to her comfortable task , feeling as if fairies still haunted the world as in the good old times ."
2544,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"When Belle came back with a handful of roses , she found Lizzie absorbed in admiring contemplation of her new boots , as she ate sponge-cake in a blissful sort of waking-dream ."
2545,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,`` Mamma ca n't come ; but I do n't care about the hat .
2546,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"It will do very well , and is n't worth fussing about ."
2547,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"There , will those be of any use to you ? ''"
2548,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,And she offered the nosegay with a much happier face than the one Lizzie first saw .
2549,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Oh , miss , they 're just lovely !"
2550,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I 'll copy that pink rose as soon as ever I can , and when I 've learned how to do 'em tip-top , I 'd like to bring you some , if you do n't mind , '' answered Lizzie , smiling all over her face as she buried her nose luxuriously in the fragrant mass ."
2551,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` I 'd like it very much , for I should think you 'd have to be very clever to make such pretty things ."
2552,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I really quite fancy those rosebuds in my hat , now I know that you 're going to learn how to make them ."
2553,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Put an orange in your pocket , and the flowers in water as soon as you can , so they 'll be fresh when you want them ."
2554,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Good-by .
2555,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Bring home our hats every time and tell me how you get on . ''
2556,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"With kind words like these , Belle dismissed Lizzie , who ran downstairs , feeling as rich as if she had found a fortune ."
2557,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Away to the next place she hurried , anxious to get her errands done and the precious posy safely into fresh water ."
2558,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"But Mrs. Turretviile was not at home , and the bonnet could not be left till paid for ."
2559,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"So Lizzie turned to go down the high steps , glad that she need not wait ."
2560,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"She stopped one instant to take a delicious sniff at her flowers , and that was the last happy moment that poor Lizzie knew for many weary months ."
2561,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"The new boots were large for her , the steps slippery with sleet , and down went the little errand girl , from top to bottom , till she landed in the gutter directly upon Mrs. Turretville 's costly bonnet ."
2562,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` I 've saved my posies , anyway , '' sighed Lizzie , as she picked herself up , bruised , wet , and faint with pain ; `` but , oh , my heart ! wo n't Madame scold when she sees that band-box smashed flat , '' groaned the poor child , sitting on the curbstone to get her breath and view the disaster ."
2563,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"The rain poured , the wind blew , the sparrows on the park railing chirped derisively , and no one came along to help Lizzie out of her troubles ."
2564,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Slowly she gathered up her burdens ; painfully she limped away in the big boots ; and the last the naughty sparrows saw of her was a shabby little figure going round the corner , with a pale , tearful face held lovingly over the bright bouquet that was her one treasure and her only comfort in the moment which brought to her the great misfortune of her life ."
2565,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,II .
2566,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"FORGET-ME-NOTS `` Oh , mamma , I am so relieved that the box has come at last !"
2567,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"If it had not , I do believe I should have died of disappointment , '' cried pretty Belle , five years later , on the morning before her eighteenth birthday ."
2568,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` It would have been a serious disappointment , darling ; for I had sot my heart on your wearing my gift to-morrow night , and when the steamers kept coming in without my trunk from Paris , I was very anxious ."
2569,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,I hope you will like it . ''
2570,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Dear mamma , I know I shall like it ; your taste is so good and you know what suits me so well ."
2571,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Make haste , Marie ; I 'm dying to see it , '' said Belle , dancing about the great trunk , as the maid carefully unfolded tissue papers and muslin wrappers ."
2572,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"A young girl 's first ball-dress is a grand affair , -- in her eyes , at least ; and Belle soon stopped dancing , to stand with clasped hands , eager eyes and parted lips before the snowy pile of illusion that was at last daintily lifted out upon the bed ."
2573,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Then , as Marie displayed its loveliness , little cries of delight were heard , and when the whole delicate dress was arranged to the best effect she threw herself upon her mother 's neck and actually cried with pleasure ."
2574,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Mamma , it is too lovely I and you are very kind to do so much for me ."
2575,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,How shall I ever thank you ? ''
2576,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` By putting it right on to see if it fits ; and when you wear it look your happiest , that I may be proud of my pretty daughter . ''"
2577,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Mamma got no further , for Marie uttered a French shriek , wrung her hands , and then began to burrow wildly in the trunk and among the papers , crying distractedly : `` Great Heavens , madame ! the wreath has been forgotten !"
2578,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,What an affliction !
2579,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Mademoiselle 's enchanting toilette is destroyed without the wreath , and nowhere do I find it . ''"
2580,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,In vain they searched ; in vain Marie wailed and Belle declared it must be somewhere ; no wreath appeared .
2581,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"It was duly set down in the bill , and a fine sum charged for a head-dress to match the dainty forget-me-nots that looped the fleecy skirts and ornamented the bosom of the dress ."
2582,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"It had evidently been forgotten ; and mamma despatched Marie at once to try and match the flowers , for Belle would not hear of any other decoration for her beautiful blonde hair ."
2583,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"The dress fitted to a charm , and was pronounced by all beholders the loveliest thing ever seen ."
2584,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Nothing was wanted but the wreath to make it quite perfect , and when Marie returned , after a long search , with no forget-me-nots , Belle was in despair ."
2585,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Wear natural ones , '' suggested a sympathizing friend ."
2586,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,But another hunt among greenhouses was as fruitless as that among the milliners ' rooms .
2587,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"No forget-me-nots could be found , and Marie fell exhausted into a chair , desolated at what she felt to be an awful calamity ."
2588,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Let me have the carriage , and I 'll ransack the city till I find some , '' cried Belle , growing more resolute with each failure ."
2589,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Marnma was deep in preparations for the ball , and could not help her afflicted daughter , though she was much disappointed at the mishap ."
2590,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"So Belle drove off , resolved to have her flowers whether there were any or not ."
2591,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Any one who has ever tried to match a ribbon , find a certain fabric , or get anything done in a hurry , knows what a wearisome task it sometimes is , and can imagine Belle 's state of mind after repeated disappointments ."
2592,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"She was about to give up in despair , when some one suggested that perhaps the Frenchwoman , Estelle Valnor , might make the desired wreath , if there was time ."
2593,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Away drove Belle , and , on entering the room , gave a sigh of satisfaction , for a whole boxful of the loveliest forget-me-nots stood upon the table ."
2594,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"As fast as possible , she told her tale and demanded the flowers , no matter what the price might be ."
2595,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Imagine her feelings when the Frenchwoman , with a shrug , announced that it was impossible to give mademoiselle a single spray ."
2596,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"All were engaged to trim a bridesmaid 's dress , and must be sent away at once ."
2597,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"It really was too bad ! and Belle lost her temper entirely , for no persuasion or bribes would win a spray from Estelle ."
2598,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"The provoking part of it was that the wedding would not come off for several days , and there was time enough to make more flowers for that dress , since Belle only wanted a few for her hair ."
2599,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Neither would Estelle make her any , as her hands were full , and so small an order was not worth deranging one 's self for ; but observing Belle 's sorrowful face , she said , affably : `` Mademoiselle may , perhaps , find the flowers she desires at Miss Berton 's ."
2600,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"She has been helping me with these garlands , and may have some left ."
2601,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Here is her address . ''
2602,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Belle took the card with thanks , and hurried away with a last hope faintly stirring in her girlish heart , for Belle had an unusually ardent wish to look her best at this party , since Somebody was to be there , and Somebody considered forget-me-nots the sweetest flowers in the world ."
2603,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Mamma knew this , and the kiss Belle gave her when the dress came had a more tender meaning than gratified vanity or daughterly love ."
2604,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Up many stairs she climbed , and came at last to a little room , very poor but very neat , where , at the one window , sat a young girl , with crutches by her side and her lap full of flower-leaves and petals ."
2605,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"She rose slowly as Belle came in , and then stood looking at her , with such a wistful expression in her shy , bright eyes , that Belle 's anxious face cleared involuntarily , and her voice lost its impatient tone ."
2606,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"As she spoke , she glanced about the room , hoping to see some blue blossoms awaiting her ."
2607,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"But none appeared ; and she was about to despond again , when the girl said , gently : `` I have none by me now , but I may be able to find you some . ''"
2608,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,`` Thank you very much ; but I have been everywhere in vain .
2609,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Still , if you do get any , please send them to me as soon as possible ."
2610,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Here is my card . ''
2611,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Miss Berton glanced at it , then cast a quick look at the sweet , anxious face before her , and smiled so brightly that Belle smiled also , and asked , wonderingly : `` What is it ?"
2612,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,What do you see ? ''
2613,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,`` I see the dear young lady who was so kind to me long ago .
2614,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"You do n't remember me , and never knew my name ; but I never have forgotten you all these years ."
2615,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I always hoped I could do something to show how grateful I was , and now I can , for you shall have your flowers if I sit up all night to make them . ''"
2616,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"But Belle still shook her head and watched the smiling face before her with wondering eyes , till the girl added , with sudden color in her cheeks : `` Ah , you 've done so many kind things in your life , you do n't remember the little errand girl from Madame Tifany 's who stole a rose in your hall , and how you gave her rubber boots and cake and flowers , and were so good to her she could n't forget it if she lived to be a hundred . ''"
2617,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` But you are so changed , '' began Belle , who did faintly recollect that little incident in her happy life ."
2618,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Yes , I had a fall and hurt myself so that I shall always be lame . ''"
2619,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"And Lizzie went on to tell how Madame had dismissed her in a rage ; how she lay ill till Mrs. Brown sent her to the hospital ; and how for a year she had suffered much alone , in that great house of pain , before one of the kind visitors had befriended her ."
2620,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"While hearing the story of the five years , that had been so full of pleasure , ease and love for herself , Belle forgot her errand , and , sitting beside Lizzie , listened with pitying eyes to all she told of her endeavors to support herself by the delicate handiwork she loved ."
2621,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` I 'm very happy now , '' ended Lizzie , looking about the little bare room with a face full of the sweetest content ."
2622,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` I get nearly work enough to pay my way , and Estelle sends me some when she has more than she can do ."
2623,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I 've learned to do it nicely , and it is so pleasant to sit here and make flowers instead of trudging about in the wet with other people 's hats ."
2624,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Though I do sometimes wish I was able to trudge , one gets on so slowly with crutches . ''"
2625,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"A little sigh followed the words , and Belle put her own plump hand on the delicate one that held the crutch , saying , in her cordial young voice : `` I 'll come and take you to drive sometimes , for you are too pale , and you 'll get ill sitting here at work day after day ."
2626,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Please let me ; I 'd love to ; for I feel so idle and wicked when I see busy people like you that I reproach myself for neglecting my duty and having more than my share of happiness . ''
2627,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Lizzie thanked her with a look , and then said , in a tone of interest that was delightful to hear : `` Tell about the wreath you want ; I should so love to do it for you , if I can . ''"
2628,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Belle had forgotten all about it in listening to this sad little story of a girl 's life .
2629,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Now she felt half ashamed to talk of so frivolous a matter till she remembered that it would help Lizzie ; and , resolving to pay for it as never garland was paid for before , she entered upon the subject with renewed interest ."
2630,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,`` You shall have the flowers in time for your ball to-morrow night .
2631,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I will engage to make a wreath that will please you , only it may take longer than I think ."
2632,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Do n't be troubled if I do n't send it till evening ; it will surely come in time .
2633,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I can work fast , and this will be the happiest job I ever did , '' said Lizzie , beginning to lay out mysterious little tools and bend delicate wires ."
2634,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,`` You are altogether too grateful for the little I have done .
2635,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,It makes me feel ashamed to think I did not find you out before and do something better worth thanks . ''
2636,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Ah , it was n't the boots or the cake or the roses , dear Miss Belle ."
2637,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"It was the kind looks , the gentle words , the way it was done , that went right to my heart , and did me more good than a million of money ."
2638,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I never stole a pin after that day , for the little rose would n't let me forget how you forgave me so sweetly ."
2639,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I sometimes think it kept me from greater temptations , for I was a poor , forlorn child , with no one to keep me good . ''"
2640,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Pretty Belle looked prettier than ever as she listened , and a bright tear stood in either eye like a drop of dew on a blue flower ."
2641,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"It touched her very much to learn that her little act of childish charity had been so sweet and helpful to this lonely girl , and now lived so freshly in her grateful memory ."
2642,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"It showed her , suddenly , how precious little deeds of love and sympathy are ; how strong to bless , how easy to perform , how comfortable to recall ."
2643,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Her heart was very full and tender just then , and the lesson sunk deep into it never to be forgotten ."
2644,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"She sat a long time watching flowers bud and blossom under Lizzie 's skilful fingers , and then hurried home to tell all her glad news to mamma ."
2645,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"If the next day had not been full of most delightfully exciting events , Belle might have felt some anxiety about her wreath , for hour after hour went by and nothing arrived from Lizzie ."
2646,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Evening came , and all was ready ."
2647,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Belle was dressed , and looked so lovely that mamma declared she needed nothing more ."
2648,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,But Marie insisted that the grand effect would be ruined without the garland among the sunshiny hair .
2649,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Belle had time now to be anxious , and waited with growing impatience for the finishing touch to her charming toilette ."
2650,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` I must be downstairs to receive , and ca n't wait another moment ; so put in the blue pompon and let me go , '' she said at last , with a sigh of disappointment , for the desire to look beautiful that night in Somebody 's eyes had increased four-fold ."
2651,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"With a tragic gesture , Marie was about to adjust the pompon when the quick tap of a crutch came down the hall , and Lizzie hurried in , flushed and breathless , but smiling happily as she uncovered the box she carried with a look of proud satisfaction ."
2652,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"A general `` Ah ! '' of admiration arose as Belle , mamma , and Marie surveyed the lovely wreath that lay before them ; and when it was carefully arranged on the bright head that was to wear it , Belle blushed with pleasure ."
2653,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"Mamma said : `` It is more beautiful than any Paris could have sent us ; '' and Marie clasped her hands theatrically , sighing , with her head on one side : `` Truly , yes ; mademoiselle is now adorable ! ''"
2654,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,`` I am so glad you like it .
2655,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"I did my very best and worked all night , but I had to beg one spray from Estelle , or , with all my haste , I could not have finished in time , '' said Lizzie , refreshing her weary eyes with a long , affectionate gaze at the pretty figure before her ."
2656,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"A fold of the airy skirt was caught on one of the blue clusters , and Lizzie knelt down to arrange it as she spoke ."
2657,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,Belle leaned toward her and said softly : `` Money alone ca n't pay you for this kindness ; so tell me how I can best serve you .
2658,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"This is the happiest night of my life , and I want to make every one feel glad also . ''"
2659,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` Then do n't talk of paying me , but promise that I may make the flowers you wear on your wedding-day , '' whispered Lizzie , kissing the kind hand held out to help her rise , for on it she saw a brilliant ring , and in the blooming , blushing face bent over her she read the tender little story that Somebody had told Belle that day ."
2660,Louisa May Alcott,Marjorie's Three Gifts,,"`` So you shall ! and I 'll keep this wreath all my life for your sake , dear , '' answered Belle , as her full heart bubbled over with pitying affection for the poor girl who would never make a bridal garland for herself ."
2661,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,DING-DONG !
2662,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Ding-dong !
2663,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Ding-dong !
2664,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"The town crier has rung his bell , at a distant corner , and little Annie stands on her father 's doorsteps , trying to hear what the man with the loud voice is talking about ."
2665,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Let me listen too .
2666,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"O , he is telling the people that an elephant , and a lion , and a royal tiger , and a horse with horns , and other strange beasts from foreign countries , have come to town , and will receive all visitors who choose to wait upon them !"
2667,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Perhaps little Annie would like to go .
2668,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Yes ; and I can see that the pretty child is weary of this wide and pleasant street , with the green trees flinging their shade across the quiet sunshine , and the pavements and the sidewalks all as clean as if the housemaid had just swept them with her broom ."
2669,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"She feels that impulse to go strolling away -- that longing after the mystery of the great world -- which many children feel , and which I felt in my childhood ."
2670,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Little Annie shall take a ramble with me .
2671,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,See !
2672,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"I do but hold out my hand , and , like some bright bird in the sunny air , with her blue silk frock fluttering upwards from her white pantalets , she comes bounding on tiptoe across the street ."
2673,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Smooth back your brown curls , Annie ; and let me tie on your bonnet , and we will set forth !"
2674,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,What a strange couple to go on their rambles together !
2675,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"One walks in black attire , with a measured step , and a heavy brow , and his thoughtful eyes bent down , while the gay little girl trips lightly along , as if she were forced to keep hold of my hand , lest her feet should dance away from the earth ."
2676,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Yet there is sympathy between us .
2677,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"If I pride myself on anything , it is because I have a smile that children love ; and , on the other hand , there are few grown ladies that could entice me from the side of little Annie ; for I delight to let my mind go hand in hand with the mind of a sinless child ."
2678,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"So , come , Annie ; but if I moralize as we go , do not listen to me ; only look about you , and be merry !"
2679,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Now we turn the corner .
2680,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Here are hacks with two horses , and stage-coaches with four , thundering to meet each other , and trucks and carts moving at a slower pace , being heavily laden with barrels from the wharves , and here are rattling gigs , which perhaps will be smashed to pieces before our eyes ."
2681,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Hitherward , also , comes a man trundling a wheelbarrow along the pavement ."
2682,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Is not little Annie afraid of such a tumult ?
2683,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"No ; she does not even shrink closer to my side , but passes on with fearless confidence , a happy child amidst a great throng of grown people , who pay the same reverence to her infancy that they would to extreme old age ."
2684,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Nobody jostles her ; all turn aside to make way for little Annie ; and , what is most singular , she appears conscious of her claim to such respect ."
2685,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Now her eyes brighten with pleasure !
2686,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"A street-musician has seated himself on the steps of yonder church , and pours forth his strains to the busy town , a melody that has gone astray among the tramp of footsteps , the buzz of voices , and the war of passing wheels ."
2687,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Who heeds the poor organ-grinder ?
2688,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"None but myself and little Annie , whose feet begin to move in unison with the lively tune , as if she were loath that music should be wasted without a dance ."
2689,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,But where would Annie find a partner ?
2690,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Some have the gout in their toes , or the rheumatism in their joints ; some are stiff with age ; some feeble with disease ; some are so lean that their bones would rattle , and others of such ponderous size that their agility would crack the flagstones ; but many , many have leaden feet , because their hearts are far heavier than lead ."
2691,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,It is a sad thought that I have chanced upon .
2692,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,What a company of dancers should we be !
2693,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"For I , too , am a gentleman of sober footsteps , and therefore , little Annie , let us walk sedately on ."
2694,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"It is a question with me , whether this giddy child , or my sage self , have most pleasure in looking at the shop-windows ."
2695,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"We love the silks of sunny hue , that glow within the darkened premises of the spruce drygoods ' men ; we are pleasantly dazzled by the burnished silver , and the chased gold , the rings of wedlock and the costly love-ornaments , glistening at the window of the jeweller ; but Annie , more than I , seeks for a glimpse of her passing figure in the dusty looking-glasses at the hardware stores ."
2696,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,All that is bright and gay attracts us both .
2697,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Here is a shop to which the recollections of my boyhood , as well as present partialities , give a peculiar magic ."
2698,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"How delightful to let the fancy revel on the dainties of a confectioner ; those pies , with such white and flaky paste , their contents being a mystery , whether rich mince , with whole plums intermixed , or piquant apple , delicately rose-flavored ; those cakes , heart-shaped or round , piled in a lofty pyramid ; those sweet little circlets , sweetly named kisses ; those dark , majestic masses , fit to be bridal-loaves at the wedding of an heiress , mountains in size , their summits deeply snow-covered with sugar !"
2699,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Then the mighty treasures of sugar-plums , white and crimson and yellow , in large glass vases ; and candy of all varieties ; and those little cockles , or whatever they are called , much prized by children for their sweetness , and more for the mottoes which they enclose , by love-sick maids and bachelors !"
2700,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"O , my mouth waters , little Annie , and so doth yours ; but we will not be tempted , except to an imaginary feast ; so let us hasten onward , devouring the vision of a plum-cake ."
2701,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Here are pleasures , as some people would say , of a more exalted kind , in the window of a bookseller ."
2702,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Is Annie a literary lady ?
2703,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Yes ; she is deeply read in Peter Parley 's tomes , and has an increasing love for fairy-tales , though seldom met with nowadays , and she will subscribe , next year , to the Juvenile Miscellany ."
2704,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"But , truth to tell , she is apt to turn away from the printed page , and keep gazing at the pretty pictures , such as the gay-colored ones which make this shopwindow the continual loitering-place of children ."
2705,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"What would Annie think , if , in the book which I mean to send her , on New Year 's day , she should find her sweet little self , bound up in silk or morocco with gilt edges , there to remain till she become a woman grown with children of her own to read about their mother 's childhood !"
2706,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,That would be very queer .
2707,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Little Annie is weary of pictures , and pulls me onward by the hand , till suddenly we pause at the most wondrous shop in all the town ."
2708,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"O , my stars !"
2709,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Is this a toy-shop , or is it fairy-land ?"
2710,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"For here are gilded chariots , in which the king and queen of the fairies might ride side by side , while their courtiers , on these small horses , should gallop in triumphal procession before and behind the royal pair ."
2711,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Here , too , are dishes of china-ware , fit to be the dining set of those same princely personages , when they make a regal banquet in the stateliest ball of their palace , full five feet high , and behold their nobles feasting adown the long perspective of the table ."
2712,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Betwixt the king and queen should sit my little Annie , the prettiest fairy of them all ."
2713,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Here stands a turbaned Turk , threatening us with his sabre , like an ugly heathen as he is ."
2714,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"And next a Chinese mandarin , who nods his head at Annie and myself ."
2715,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Here we may review a whole army of horse and foot , in red and blue uniforms , with drums , fifes , trumpets , and all kinds of noiseless music ; they have halted on the shelf of this window , after their weary march from Liliput ."
2716,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,But what cares Annie for soldiers ?
2717,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"No conquering queen is she , neither a Semiramis nor a Catharine , her whole heart is set upon that doll , who gazes at us with such a fashionable stare ."
2718,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,This is the little girl 's true plaything .
2719,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Though made of wood , a doll is a visionary and ethereal personage , endowed by childish fancy with a peculiar life ; the mimic lady is a heroine of romance , an actor and a sufferer in a thousand shadowy scenes , the chief inhabitant of that wild world with which children ape the real one ."
2720,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Little Annie does not understand what I am saying , but looks wishfully at the proud lady in the window ."
2721,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,We will invite her home with us as we return .
2722,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Meantime , good by , Dame Doll !"
2723,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"A toy yourself , you look forth from your window upon many ladies that are also toys , though they walk and speak , and upon a crowd in pursuit of toys , though they wear grave visages ."
2724,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"O , with your never-closing eyes , had you but an intellect to moralize on all that flits before them , what a wise doll would you be !"
2725,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Come , little Annie , we shall find toys enough , go where we may ."
2726,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Now we elbow our way among the throng again .
2727,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"It is curious , in the most crowded part of a town , to meet with living creatures that had their birthplace in some far solitude , but have acquired a second nature in the wilderness of men ."
2728,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Look up , Annie , at that canary-bird , hanging out of the window in his cage ."
2729,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Poor little fellow !
2730,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"His golden feathers are all tarnished in this smoky sunshine ; he would have glistened twice as brightly among the summer islands ; but still he has become a citizen in all his tastes and habits , and would not sing half so well without the uproar that drowns his music ."
2731,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,What a pity that he does not know how miserable he is !
2732,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"There is a parrot , too , calling out , `` Pretty Poll !"
2733,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Pretty Poll ! '' as we pass by .
2734,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Foolish bird , to be talking about her prettiness to strangers , especially as she is not a pretty Poll , though gaudily dressed in green and yellow ."
2735,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"If she had said , `` Pretty Annie , '' there would have been some sense in it ."
2736,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"See that gray squirrel at the door of the fruit-shop , whirling round and round so merrily within his wire wheel !"
2737,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Being condemned to the treadmill , he makes it an amusement ."
2738,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Admirable philosophy !
2739,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Here comes a big , rough dog , a countryman 's dog in search of his master ; smelling at everybody 's heels , and touching little Annie 's hand with his cold nose , but hurrying away , though she would fain have patted him ."
2740,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Success to your search , Fidelity !"
2741,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"And there sits a great yellow cat upon a window-sill , a very corpulent and comfortable cat , gazing at this transitory world , with owl 's eyes , and making pithy comments , doubtless , or what appear such , to the silly beast ."
2742,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"O sage puss , make room for me beside you , and we will be a pair of philosophers !"
2743,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Here we see something to remind us of the town crier , and his ding-dong bell !"
2744,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Look ! look at that great cloth spread out in the air , pictured all over with wild beasts , as if they had met together to choose a king , according to their custom in the days of AEsop ."
2745,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,But they are choosing neither a king nor a president ; else we should hear a most horrible snarling !
2746,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"They have come from the deep woods , and the wild mountains , and the desert sands , and the polar snows , only to do homage to my little Annie ."
2747,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"As we enter among them , the great elephant makes us a bow , in the best style of elephantine courtesy , bending lowly down his mountain bulk , with trunk abased , and leg thrust out behind ."
2748,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Annie returns the salute , much to the gratification of the elephant , who is certainly the best-bred monster in the caravan ."
2749,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,The lion and the lioness are busy with two beef-bones .
2750,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"The royal tiger , the beautiful , the untamable , keeps pacing his narrow cage with a haughty step , unmindful of the spectators , or recalling the fierce deeds of his former life , when he was wont to leap forth upon such inferior animals , from the jungles of Bengal ."
2751,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Here we see the very same wolf , -- do not go near him , Annie ! -- the self-same wolf that devoured little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother ."
2752,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"In the next cage , a hyena from Egypt , who has doubtless howled around the pyramids , and a black bear from our own forests are fellow-prisoners , and most excellent friends ."
2753,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Are there any two living creatures who have so few sympathies that they can not possibly be friends ?
2754,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Here sits a great white bear , whom common observers would call a very stupid beast , though I perceive him to be only absorbed in contemplation ; he is thinking of his voyages on an iceberg , and of his comfortable home in the vicinity of the north pole , and of the little cubs whom he left rolling in the eternal snows ."
2755,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"In fact , he is a bear of sentiment ."
2756,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"But , O , those unsentimental monkeys the ugly , grinning , aping , chattering , ill-natured , mischievous , and queer little brutes ."
2757,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Annie does not love the monkeys .
2758,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Their ugliness shocks her pure , instinctive delicacy of taste , and makes her mind unquiet , because it bears a wild and dark resemblance to humanity ."
2759,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"But here is a little pony , just big enough for Annie to ride , and round and round he gallops in a circle , keeping time with his trampling hoofs to a band of music ."
2760,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"And here , -- with a laced coat and a cocked hat , and a riding whip in his hand , -- here comes a little gentleman , small enough to be king of the fairies , and ugly enough to be king of the gnomes , and takes a flying leap into the saddle ."
2761,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Merrily , merrily plays the music , and merrily gallops the pony , and merrily rides the little old gentleman ."
2762,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Come , Annie , into the street again ; perchance we may see monkeys on horseback there !"
2763,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Mercy on us , what a noisy world we quiet people live in !"
2764,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Did Annie ever read the Cries of London City ?
2765,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,With what lusty lungs doth yonder man proclaim that his wheelbarrow is full of lobsters !
2766,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Here comes another mounted on a cart , and blowing a hoarse and dreadful blast from a tin horn , as much as to say , `` Fresh fish ! ''"
2767,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"And hark ! a voice on high , like that of a muezzin from the summit of a mosque , announcing that some chimney-sweeper has emerged from smoke and soot , and darksome caverns , into the upper air ."
2768,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,What cares the world for that ?
2769,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"But , well-a-day , we hear a shrill voice of affliction , the scream of a little child , rising louder with every repetition of that smart , sharp , slapping sound , produced by an open hand on tender flesh ."
2770,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Annie sympathizes , though without experience of such direful woe ."
2771,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Lo ! the town crier again , with some new secret for the public ear ."
2772,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Will he tell us of an auction , or of a lost pocketbook , or a show of beautiful wax figures , or of some monstrous beast more horrible than any in the caravan ?"
2773,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,I guess the latter .
2774,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"See how he uplifts the bell in his right hand , and shakes it slowly at first , then with a hurried motion , till the clapper seems to strike both sides at once , and the sounds are scattered forth in quick succession , far and near ."
2775,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Ding-dong !
2776,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Ding-dong !
2777,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Ding-dong !
2778,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Now he raises his clear , loud voice , above all the din of the town ; it drowns the buzzing talk of many tongues , and draws each man 's mind from his own business ; it rolls up and down the echoing street and ascends to the hushed chamber of the sick , and penetrates downward to the cellar kitchen , where the hot cook turns from the fire to listen ."
2779,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Who , of all that address the public ear , whether in church , or court-house , or hall of state , has such an attentive audience as the town crier ?"
2780,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,What saith the people 's orator ?
2781,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"`` Strayed from her home , a LITTLE GIRL , of five years old , in a blue silk frock and white pantalets , with brown curling hair and hazel eyes ."
2782,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Whoever will bring her back to her afflicted mother -- '' Stop , stop , town crier !"
2783,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,The lost is found .
2784,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"O , my pretty Annie , we forgot to tell your mother of our ramble , and she is in despair , and has sent the town crier to bellow up and down the streets , afrighting old and young , for the loss of a little girl who has not once let go my hand !"
2785,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Well , let us hasten homeward ; and as we go , forget not to thank Heaven , my Annie , that , after wandering a little way into the world , you may return at the first summons , with an untainted and unwearied heart , and be a happy child again ."
2786,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,But I have gone too far astray for the town crier to call me back .
2787,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Sweet has been the charm of childhood on my spirit , throughout my ramble with little Annie !"
2788,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"Say not that it has been a waste of precious moments , an idle matter , a babble of childish talk , and a revery of childish imaginations , about topics unworthy of a grown man 's notice ."
2789,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Has it been merely this ?
2790,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Not so ; not so .
2791,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,They are not truly wise who would affirm it .
2792,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"As the pure breath of children revives the life of aged men , so is our moral nature revived by their free and simple thoughts , their native feeling , their airy mirth , for little cause or none , their grief , soon roused and soon allayed ."
2793,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,Their influence on us is at least reciprocal with ours on them .
2794,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"When our infancy is almost forgotten , and our boyhood long departed , though it seems but as yesterday ; when life settles darkly down upon us , and we doubt whether to call ourselves young any more , then it is good to steal away from the society of bearded men , and even of gentler woman , and spend an hour or two with children ."
2795,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Little Annie's Ramble,,"After drinking from those fountains of still fresh existence , we shall return into the crowd , as I do now , to struggle onward and do our part in life , perhaps as fervently as ever , but , for a time , with a kinder and purer heart , and a spirit more lightly wise ."
2796,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"A pleasing land of drowsy head it was , Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye ; And of gay castles in the clouds that pass , Forever flushing round a summer sky ."
2797,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"In the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern shore of the Hudson , at that broad expansion of the river denominated by the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee , and where they always prudently shortened sail and implored the protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed , there lies a small market town or rural port , which by some is called Greensburgh , but which is more generally and properly known by the name of Tarry Town ."
2798,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"This name was given , we are told , in former days , by the good housewives of the adjacent country , from the inveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village tavern on market days ."
2799,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Be that as it may , I do not vouch for the fact , but merely advert to it , for the sake of being precise and authentic ."
2800,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Not far from this village , perhaps about two miles , there is a little valley or rather lap of land among high hills , which is one of the quietest places in the whole world ."
2801,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"A small brook glides through it , with just murmur enough to lull one to repose ; and the occasional whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity ."
2802,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"I recollect that , when a stripling , my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley ."
2803,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"I had wandered into it at noontime , when all nature is peculiarly quiet , and was startled by the roar of my own gun , as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes ."
2804,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"If ever I should wish for a retreat whither I might steal from the world and its distractions , and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled life , I know of none more promising than this little valley ."
2805,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"From the listless repose of the place , and the peculiar character of its inhabitants , who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers , this sequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW , and its rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the neighboring country ."
2806,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"A drowsy , dreamy influence seems to hang over the land , and to pervade the very atmosphere ."
2807,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Some say that the place was bewitched by a High German doctor , during the early days of the settlement ; others , that an old Indian chief , the prophet or wizard of his tribe , held his powwows there before the country was discovered by Master Hendrick Hudson ."
2808,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Certain it is , the place still continues under the sway of some witching power , that holds a spell over the minds of the good people , causing them to walk in a continual reverie ."
2809,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"They are given to all kinds of marvellous beliefs , are subject to trances and visions , and frequently see strange sights , and hear music and voices in the air ."
2810,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The whole neighborhood abounds with local tales , haunted spots , and twilight superstitions ; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across the valley than in any other part of the country , and the nightmare , with her whole ninefold , seems to make it the favorite scene of her gambols ."
2811,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The dominant spirit , however , that haunts this enchanted region , and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air , is the apparition of a figure on horseback , without a head ."
2812,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper , whose head had been carried away by a cannon-ball , in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War , and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in the gloom of night , as if on the wings of the wind ."
2813,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"His haunts are not confined to the valley , but extend at times to the adjacent roads , and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance ."
2814,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Indeed , certain of the most authentic historians of those parts , who have been careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this spectre , allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in the churchyard , the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head , and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes passes along the Hollow , like a midnight blast , is owing to his being belated , and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak ."
2815,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Such is the general purport of this legendary superstition , which has furnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows ; and the spectre is known at all the country firesides , by the name of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow ."
2816,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have mentioned is not confined to the native inhabitants of the valley , but is unconsciously imbibed by every one who resides there for a time ."
2817,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"However wide awake they may have been before they entered that sleepy region , they are sure , in a little time , to inhale the witching influence of the air , and begin to grow imaginative , to dream dreams , and see apparitions ."
2818,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"I mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud , for it is in such little retired Dutch valleys , found here and there embosomed in the great State of New York , that population , manners , and customs remain fixed , while the great torrent of migration and improvement , which is making such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country , sweeps by them unobserved ."
2819,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"They are like those little nooks of still water , which border a rapid stream , where we may see the straw and bubble riding quietly at anchor , or slowly revolving in their mimic harbor , undisturbed by the rush of the passing current ."
2820,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Though many years have elapsed since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow , yet I question whether I should not still find the same trees and the same families vegetating in its sheltered bosom ."
2821,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"In this by-place of nature there abode , in a remote period of American history , that is to say , some thirty years since , a worthy wight of the name of Ichabod Crane , who sojourned , or , as he expressed it , `` tarried , '' in Sleepy Hollow , for the purpose of instructing the children of the vicinity ."
2822,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He was a native of Connecticut , a State which supplies the Union with pioneers for the mind as well as for the forest , and sends forth yearly its legions of frontier woodmen and country schoolmasters ."
2823,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,The cognomen of Crane was not inapplicable to his person .
2824,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He was tall , but exceedingly lank , with narrow shoulders , long arms and legs , hands that dangled a mile out of his sleeves , feet that might have served for shovels , and his whole frame most loosely hung together ."
2825,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"His head was small , and flat at top , with huge ears , large green glassy eyes , and a long snipe nose , so that it looked like a weather-cock perched upon his spindle neck to tell which way the wind blew ."
2826,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"To see him striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day , with his clothes bagging and fluttering about him , one might have mistaken him for the genius of famine descending upon the earth , or some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield ."
2827,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"His schoolhouse was a low building of one large room , rudely constructed of logs ; the windows partly glazed , and partly patched with leaves of old copybooks ."
2828,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It was most ingeniously secured at vacant hours , by a withe twisted in the handle of the door , and stakes set against the window shutters ; so that though a thief might get in with perfect ease , he would find some embarrassment in getting out , -- an idea most probably borrowed by the architect , Yost Van Houten , from the mystery of an eelpot ."
2829,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The schoolhouse stood in a rather lonely but pleasant situation , just at the foot of a woody hill , with a brook running close by , and a formidable birch-tree growing at one end of it ."
2830,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"From hence the low murmur of his pupils ' voices , conning over their lessons , might be heard in a drowsy summer 's day , like the hum of a beehive ; interrupted now and then by the authoritative voice of the master , in the tone of menace or command , or , peradventure , by the appalling sound of the birch , as he urged some tardy loiterer along the flowery path of knowledge ."
2831,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Truth to say , he was a conscientious man , and ever bore in mind the golden maxim , `` Spare the rod and spoil the child . ''"
2832,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,Ichabod Crane 's scholars certainly were not spoiled .
2833,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"I would not have it imagined , however , that he was one of those cruel potentates of the school who joy in the smart of their subjects ; on the contrary , he administered justice with discrimination rather than severity ; taking the burden off the backs of the weak , and laying it on those of the strong ."
2834,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Your mere puny stripling , that winced at the least flourish of the rod , was passed by with indulgence ; but the claims of justice were satisfied by inflicting a double portion on some little tough wrong-headed , broad-skirted Dutch urchin , who sulked and swelled and grew dogged and sullen beneath the birch ."
2835,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"All this he called `` doing his duty by their parents ; '' and he never inflicted a chastisement without following it by the assurance , so consolatory to the smarting urchin , that `` he would remember it and thank him for it the longest day he had to live . ''"
2836,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"When school hours were over , he was even the companion and playmate of the larger boys ; and on holiday afternoons would convoy some of the smaller ones home , who happened to have pretty sisters , or good housewives for mothers , noted for the comforts of the cupboard ."
2837,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Indeed , it behooved him to keep on good terms with his pupils ."
2838,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The revenue arising from his school was small , and would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him with daily bread , for he was a huge feeder , and , though lank , had the dilating powers of an anaconda ; but to help out his maintenance , he was , according to country custom in those parts , boarded and lodged at the houses of the farmers whose children he instructed ."
2839,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"With these he lived successively a week at a time , thus going the rounds of the neighborhood , with all his worldly effects tied up in a cotton handkerchief ."
2840,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"That all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his rustic patrons , who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a grievous burden , and schoolmasters as mere drones , he had various ways of rendering himself both useful and agreeable ."
2841,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He assisted the farmers occasionally in the lighter labors of their farms , helped to make hay , mended the fences , took the horses to water , drove the cows from pasture , and cut wood for the winter fire ."
2842,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He laid aside , too , all the dominant dignity and absolute sway with which he lorded it in his little empire , the school , and became wonderfully gentle and ingratiating ."
2843,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He found favor in the eyes of the mothers by petting the children , particularly the youngest ; and like the lion bold , which whilom so magnanimously the lamb did hold , he would sit with a child on one knee , and rock a cradle with his foot for whole hours together ."
2844,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"In addition to his other vocations , he was the singing-master of the neighborhood , and picked up many bright shillings by instructing the young folks in psalmody ."
2845,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It was a matter of no little vanity to him on Sundays , to take his station in front of the church gallery , with a band of chosen singers ; where , in his own mind , he completely carried away the palm from the parson ."
2846,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Certain it is , his voice resounded far above all the rest of the congregation ; and there are peculiar quavers still to be heard in that church , and which may even be heard half a mile off , quite to the opposite side of the millpond , on a still Sunday morning , which are said to be legitimately descended from the nose of Ichabod Crane ."
2847,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Thus , by divers little makeshifts , in that ingenious way which is commonly denominated `` by hook and by crook , '' the worthy pedagogue got on tolerably enough , and was thought , by all who understood nothing of the labor of headwork , to have a wonderfully easy life of it ."
2848,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The schoolmaster is generally a man of some importance in the female circle of a rural neighborhood ; being considered a kind of idle , gentlemanlike personage , of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to the rough country swains , and , indeed , inferior in learning only to the parson ."
2849,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"His appearance , therefore , is apt to occasion some little stir at the tea-table of a farmhouse , and the addition of a supernumerary dish of cakes or sweetmeats , or , peradventure , the parade of a silver teapot ."
2850,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Our man of letters , therefore , was peculiarly happy in the smiles of all the country damsels ."
2851,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"How he would figure among them in the churchyard , between services on Sundays ; gathering grapes for them from the wild vines that overran the surrounding trees ; reciting for their amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones ; or sauntering , with a whole bevy of them , along the banks of the adjacent millpond ; while the more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back , envying his superior elegance and address ."
2852,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"From his half-itinerant life , also , he was a kind of travelling gazette , carrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house , so that his appearance was always greeted with satisfaction ."
2853,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He was , moreover , esteemed by the women as a man of great erudition , for he had read several books quite through , and was a perfect master of Cotton Mather 's `` History of New England Witchcraft , '' in which , by the way , he most firmly and potently believed ."
2854,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He was , in fact , an odd mixture of small shrewdness and simple credulity ."
2855,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"His appetite for the marvellous , and his powers of digesting it , were equally extraordinary ; and both had been increased by his residence in this spell-bound region ."
2856,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,No tale was too gross or monstrous for his capacious swallow .
2857,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It was often his delight , after his school was dismissed in the afternoon , to stretch himself on the rich bed of clover bordering the little brook that whimpered by his schoolhouse , and there con over old Mather 's direful tales , until the gathering dusk of evening made the printed page a mere mist before his eyes ."
2858,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Then , as he wended his way by swamp and stream and awful woodland , to the farmhouse where he happened to be quartered , every sound of nature , at that witching hour , fluttered his excited imagination , -- the moan of the whip-poor-will from the hillside , the boding cry of the tree toad , that harbinger of storm , the dreary hooting of the screech owl , or the sudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened from their roost ."
2859,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The fireflies , too , which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places , now and then startled him , as one of uncommon brightness would stream across his path ; and if , by chance , a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging his blundering flight against him , the poor varlet was ready to give up the ghost , with the idea that he was struck with a witch 's token ."
2860,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"His only resource on such occasions , either to drown thought or drive away evil spirits , was to sing psalm tunes and the good people of Sleepy Hollow , as they sat by their doors of an evening , were often filled with awe at hearing his nasal melody , `` in linked sweetness long drawn out , '' floating from the distant hill , or along the dusky road ."
2861,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Another of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long winter evenings with the old Dutch wives , as they sat spinning by the fire , with a row of apples roasting and spluttering along the hearth , and listen to their marvellous tales of ghosts and goblins , and haunted fields , and haunted brooks , and haunted bridges , and haunted houses , and particularly of the headless horseman , or Galloping Hessian of the Hollow , as they sometimes called him ."
2862,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He would delight them equally by his anecdotes of witchcraft , and of the direful omens and portentous sights and sounds in the air , which prevailed in the earlier times of Connecticut ; and would frighten them woefully with speculations upon comets and shooting stars ; and with the alarming fact that the world did absolutely turn round , and that they were half the time topsy-turvy !"
2863,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"But if there was a pleasure in all this , while snugly cuddling in the chimney corner of a chamber that was all of a ruddy glow from the crackling wood fire , and where , of course , no spectre dared to show its face , it was dearly purchased by the terrors of his subsequent walk homewards ."
2864,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"What fearful shapes and shadows beset his path , amidst the dim and ghastly glare of a snowy night !"
2865,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,With what wistful look did he eye every trembling ray of light streaming across the waste fields from some distant window !
2866,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"How often was he appalled by some shrub covered with snow , which , like a sheeted spectre , beset his very path !"
2867,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"How often did he shrink with curdling awe at the sound of his own steps on the frosty crust beneath his feet ; and dread to look over his shoulder , lest he should behold some uncouth being tramping close behind him !"
2868,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"And how often was he thrown into complete dismay by some rushing blast , howling among the trees , in the idea that it was the Galloping Hessian on one of his nightly scourings !"
2869,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"All these , however , were mere terrors of the night , phantoms of the mind that walk in darkness ; and though he had seen many spectres in his time , and been more than once beset by Satan in divers shapes , in his lonely perambulations , yet daylight put an end to all these evils ; and he would have passed a pleasant life of it , in despite of the Devil and all his works , if his path had not been crossed by a being that causes more perplexity to mortal man than ghosts , goblins , and the whole race of witches put together , and that was -- a woman ."
2870,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Among the musical disciples who assembled , one evening in each week , to receive his instructions in psalmody , was Katrina Van Tassel , the daughter and only child of a substantial Dutch farmer ."
2871,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"She was a blooming lass of fresh eighteen ; plump as a partridge ; ripe and melting and rosy-cheeked as one of her father 's peaches , and universally famed , not merely for her beauty , but her vast expectations ."
2872,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"She was withal a little of a coquette , as might be perceived even in her dress , which was a mixture of ancient and modern fashions , as most suited to set off her charms ."
2873,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"She wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold , which her great-great-grandmother had brought over from Saardam ; the tempting stomacher of the olden time , and withal a provokingly short petticoat , to display the prettiest foot and ankle in the country round ."
2874,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Ichabod Crane had a soft and foolish heart towards the sex ; and it is not to be wondered at that so tempting a morsel soon found favor in his eyes , more especially after he had visited her in her paternal mansion ."
2875,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Old Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving , contented , liberal-hearted farmer ."
2876,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He seldom , it is true , sent either his eyes or his thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm ; but within those everything was snug , happy and well-conditioned ."
2877,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He was satisfied with his wealth , but not proud of it ; and piqued himself upon the hearty abundance , rather than the style in which he lived ."
2878,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"His stronghold was situated on the banks of the Hudson , in one of those green , sheltered , fertile nooks in which the Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling ."
2879,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"A great elm tree spread its broad branches over it , at the foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water , in a little well formed of a barrel ; and then stole sparkling away through the grass , to a neighboring brook , that babbled along among alders and dwarf willows ."
2880,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Hard by the farmhouse was a vast barn , that might have served for a church ; every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the treasures of the farm ; the flail was busily resounding within it from morning to night ; swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the eaves ; and rows of pigeons , some with one eye turned up , as if watching the weather , some with their heads under their wings or buried in their bosoms , and others swelling , and cooing , and bowing about their dames , were enjoying the sunshine on the roof ."
2881,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Sleek unwieldy porkers were grunting in the repose and abundance of their pens , from whence sallied forth , now and then , troops of sucking pigs , as if to snuff the air ."
2882,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"A stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond , convoying whole fleets of ducks ; regiments of turkeys were gobbling through the farmyard , and Guinea fowls fretting about it , like ill-tempered housewives , with their peevish , discontented cry ."
2883,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Before the barn door strutted the gallant cock , that pattern of a husband , a warrior and a fine gentleman , clapping his burnished wings and crowing in the pride and gladness of his heart , -- sometimes tearing up the earth with his feet , and then generously calling his ever-hungry family of wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered ."
2884,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,The pedagogue 's mouth watered as he looked upon this sumptuous promise of luxurious winter fare .
2885,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"In his devouring mind 's eye , he pictured to himself every roasting-pig running about with a pudding in his belly , and an apple in his mouth ; the pigeons were snugly put to bed in a comfortable pie , and tucked in with a coverlet of crust ; the geese were swimming in their own gravy ; and the ducks pairing cosily in dishes , like snug married couples , with a decent competency of onion sauce ."
2886,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"In the porkers he saw carved out the future sleek side of bacon , and juicy relishing ham ; not a turkey but he beheld daintily trussed up , with its gizzard under its wing , and , peradventure , a necklace of savory sausages ; and even bright chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his back , in a side dish , with uplifted claws , as if craving that quarter which his chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living ."
2887,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"As the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this , and as he rolled his great green eyes over the fat meadow lands , the rich fields of wheat , of rye , of buckwheat , and Indian corn , and the orchards burdened with ruddy fruit , which surrounded the warm tenement of Van Tassel , his heart yearned after the damsel who was to inherit these domains , and his imagination expanded with the idea , how they might be readily turned into cash , and the money invested in immense tracts of wild land , and shingle palaces in the wilderness ."
2888,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Nay , his busy fancy already realized his hopes , and presented to him the blooming Katrina , with a whole family of children , mounted on the top of a wagon loaded with household trumpery , with pots and kettles dangling beneath ; and he beheld himself bestriding a pacing mare , with a colt at her heels , setting out for Kentucky , Tennessee , -- or the Lord knows where !"
2889,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"When he entered the house , the conquest of his heart was complete ."
2890,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It was one of those spacious farmhouses , with high-ridged but lowly sloping roofs , built in the style handed down from the first Dutch settlers ; the low projecting eaves forming a piazza along the front , capable of being closed up in bad weather ."
2891,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Under this were hung flails , harness , various utensils of husbandry , and nets for fishing in the neighboring river ."
2892,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Benches were built along the sides for summer use ; and a great spinning-wheel at one end , and a churn at the other , showed the various uses to which this important porch might be devoted ."
2893,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"From this piazza the wondering Ichabod entered the hall , which formed the centre of the mansion , and the place of usual residence ."
2894,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Here rows of resplendent pewter , ranged on a long dresser , dazzled his eyes ."
2895,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"In one corner stood a huge bag of wool , ready to be spun ; in another , a quantity of linsey-woolsey just from the loom ; ears of Indian corn , and strings of dried apples and peaches , hung in gay festoons along the walls , mingled with the gaud of red peppers ; and a door left ajar gave him a peep into the best parlor , where the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables shone like mirrors ; andirons , with their accompanying shovel and tongs , glistened from their covert of asparagus tops ; mock-oranges and conch-shells decorated the mantelpiece ; strings of various-colored birds eggs were suspended above it ; a great ostrich egg was hung from the centre of the room , and a corner cupboard , knowingly left open , displayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended china ."
2896,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"From the moment Ichabod laid his eyes upon these regions of delight , the peace of his mind was at an end , and his only study was how to gain the affections of the peerless daughter of Van Tassel ."
2897,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"In this enterprise , however , he had more real difficulties than generally fell to the lot of a knight-errant of yore , who seldom had anything but giants , enchanters , fiery dragons , and such like easily conquered adversaries , to contend with and had to make his way merely through gates of iron and brass , and walls of adamant to the castle keep , where the lady of his heart was confined ; all which he achieved as easily as a man would carve his way to the centre of a Christmas pie ; and then the lady gave him her hand as a matter of course ."
2898,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Ichabod , on the contrary , had to win his way to the heart of a country coquette , beset with a labyrinth of whims and caprices , which were forever presenting new difficulties and impediments ; and he had to encounter a host of fearful adversaries of real flesh and blood , the numerous rustic admirers , who beset every portal to her heart , keeping a watchful and angry eye upon each other , but ready to fly out in the common cause against any new competitor ."
2899,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Among these , the most formidable was a burly , roaring , roystering blade , of the name of Abraham , or , according to the Dutch abbreviation , Brom Van Brunt , the hero of the country round , which rang with his feats of strength and hardihood ."
2900,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He was broad-shouldered and double-jointed , with short curly black hair , and a bluff but not unpleasant countenance , having a mingled air of fun and arrogance ."
2901,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"From his Herculean frame and great powers of limb he had received the nickname of BROM BONES , by which he was universally known ."
2902,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He was famed for great knowledge and skill in horsemanship , being as dexterous on horseback as a Tartar ."
2903,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He was foremost at all races and cock fights ; and , with the ascendancy which bodily strength always acquires in rustic life , was the umpire in all disputes , setting his hat on one side , and giving his decisions with an air and tone that admitted of no gainsay or appeal ."
2904,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He was always ready for either a fight or a frolic ; but had more mischief than ill-will in his composition ; and with all his overbearing roughness , there was a strong dash of waggish good humor at bottom ."
2905,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He had three or four boon companions , who regarded him as their model , and at the head of whom he scoured the country , attending every scene of feud or merriment for miles round ."
2906,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"In cold weather he was distinguished by a fur cap , surmounted with a flaunting fox 's tail ; and when the folks at a country gathering descried this well-known crest at a distance , whisking about among a squad of hard riders , they always stood by for a squall ."
2907,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Sometimes his crew would be heard dashing along past the farmhouses at midnight , with whoop and halloo , like a troop of Don Cossacks ; and the old dames , startled out of their sleep , would listen for a moment till the hurry-scurry had clattered by , and then exclaim , `` Ay , there goes Brom Bones and his gang ! ''"
2908,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The neighbors looked upon him with a mixture of awe , admiration , and good-will ; and , when any madcap prank or rustic brawl occurred in the vicinity , always shook their heads , and warranted Brom Bones was at the bottom of it ."
2909,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"This rantipole hero had for some time singled out the blooming Katrina for the object of his uncouth gallantries , and though his amorous toyings were something like the gentle caresses and endearments of a bear , yet it was whispered that she did not altogether discourage his hopes ."
2910,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Certain it is , his advances were signals for rival candidates to retire , who felt no inclination to cross a lion in his amours ; insomuch , that when his horse was seen tied to Van Tassel 's paling , on a Sunday night , a sure sign that his master was courting , or , as it is termed , `` sparking , '' within , all other suitors passed by in despair , and carried the war into other quarters ."
2911,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Such was the formidable rival with whom Ichabod Crane had to contend , and , considering all things , a stouter man than he would have shrunk from the competition , and a wiser man would have despaired ."
2912,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He had , however , a happy mixture of pliability and perseverance in his nature ; he was in form and spirit like a supple-jack -- yielding , but tough ; though he bent , he never broke ; and though he bowed beneath the slightest pressure , yet , the moment it was away -- jerk ! -- he was as erect , and carried his head as high as ever ."
2913,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"To have taken the field openly against his rival would have been madness ; for he was not a man to be thwarted in his amours , any more than that stormy lover , Achilles ."
2914,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Ichabod , therefore , made his advances in a quiet and gently insinuating manner ."
2915,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Under cover of his character of singing-master , he made frequent visits at the farmhouse ; not that he had anything to apprehend from the meddlesome interference of parents , which is so often a stumbling-block in the path of lovers ."
2916,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Balt Van Tassel was an easy indulgent soul ; he loved his daughter better even than his pipe , and , like a reasonable man and an excellent father , let her have her way in everything ."
2917,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"His notable little wife , too , had enough to do to attend to her housekeeping and manage her poultry ; for , as she sagely observed , ducks and geese are foolish things , and must be looked after , but girls can take care of themselves ."
2918,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Thus , while the busy dame bustled about the house , or plied her spinning-wheel at one end of the piazza , honest Balt would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other , watching the achievements of a little wooden warrior , who , armed with a sword in each hand , was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle of the barn ."
2919,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"In the mean time , Ichabod would carry on his suit with the daughter by the side of the spring under the great elm , or sauntering along in the twilight , that hour so favorable to the lover 's eloquence ."
2920,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,I profess not to know how women 's hearts are wooed and won .
2921,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,To me they have always been matters of riddle and admiration .
2922,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Some seem to have but one vulnerable point , or door of access ; while others have a thousand avenues , and may be captured in a thousand different ways ."
2923,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It is a great triumph of skill to gain the former , but a still greater proof of generalship to maintain possession of the latter , for man must battle for his fortress at every door and window ."
2924,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,He who wins a thousand common hearts is therefore entitled to some renown ; but he who keeps undisputed sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero .
2925,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Certain it is , this was not the case with the redoubtable Brom Bones ; and from the moment Ichabod Crane made his advances , the interests of the former evidently declined : his horse was no longer seen tied to the palings on Sunday nights , and a deadly feud gradually arose between him and the preceptor of Sleepy Hollow ."
2926,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Brom , who had a degree of rough chivalry in his nature , would fain have carried matters to open warfare and have settled their pretensions to the lady , according to the mode of those most concise and simple reasoners , the knights-errant of yore , -- by single combat ; but Ichabod was too conscious of the superior might of his adversary to enter the lists against him ; he had overheard a boast of Bones , that he would `` double the schoolmaster up , and lay him on a shelf of his own schoolhouse ; '' and he was too wary to give him an opportunity ."
2927,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"There was something extremely provoking in this obstinately pacific system ; it left Brom no alternative but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery in his disposition , and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his rival ."
2928,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,Ichabod became the object of whimsical persecution to Bones and his gang of rough riders .
2929,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"They harried his hitherto peaceful domains ; smoked out his singing school by stopping up the chimney ; broke into the schoolhouse at night , in spite of its formidable fastenings of withe and window stakes , and turned everything topsy-turvy , so that the poor schoolmaster began to think all the witches in the country held their meetings there ."
2930,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"But what was still more annoying , Brom took all opportunities of turning him into ridicule in presence of his mistress , and had a scoundrel dog whom he taught to whine in the most ludicrous manner , and introduced as a rival of Ichabod 's , to instruct her in psalmody ."
2931,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"In this way matters went on for some time , without producing any material effect on the relative situations of the contending powers ."
2932,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"On a fine autumnal afternoon , Ichabod , in pensive mood , sat enthroned on the lofty stool from whence he usually watched all the concerns of his little literary realm ."
2933,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"In his hand he swayed a ferule , that sceptre of despotic power ; the birch of justice reposed on three nails behind the throne , a constant terror to evil doers , while on the desk before him might be seen sundry contraband articles and prohibited weapons , detected upon the persons of idle urchins , such as half-munched apples , popguns , whirligigs , fly-cages , and whole legions of rampant little paper gamecocks ."
2934,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice recently inflicted , for his scholars were all busily intent upon their books , or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the master ; and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the schoolroom ."
2935,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a negro in tow-cloth jacket and trowsers , a round-crowned fragment of a hat , like the cap of Mercury , and mounted on the back of a ragged , wild , half-broken colt , which he managed with a rope by way of halter ."
2936,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He came clattering up to the school door with an invitation to Ichabod to attend a merry-making or `` quilting frolic , '' to be held that evening at Mynheer Van Tassel 's ; and having delivered his message with that air of importance , and effort at fine language , which a negro is apt to display on petty embassies of the kind , he dashed over the brook , and was seen scampering away up the hollow , full of the importance and hurry of his mission ."
2937,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,All was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet schoolroom .
2938,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The scholars were hurried through their lessons without stopping at trifles ; those who were nimble skipped over half with impunity , and those who were tardy had a smart application now and then in the rear , to quicken their speed or help them over a tall word ."
2939,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Books were flung aside without being put away on the shelves , inkstands were overturned , benches thrown down , and the whole school was turned loose an hour before the usual time , bursting forth like a legion of young imps , yelping and racketing about the green in joy at their early emancipation ."
2940,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra half hour at his toilet , brushing and furbishing up his best , and indeed only suit of rusty black , and arranging his locks by a bit of broken looking-glass that hung up in the schoolhouse ."
2941,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"That he might make his appearance before his mistress in the true style of a cavalier , he borrowed a horse from the farmer with whom he was domiciliated , a choleric old Dutchman of the name of Hans Van Ripper , and , thus gallantly mounted , issued forth like a knight-errant in quest of adventures ."
2942,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"But it is meet I should , in the true spirit of romantic story , give some account of the looks and equipments of my hero and his steed ."
2943,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The animal he bestrode was a broken-down plow-horse , that had outlived almost everything but its viciousness ."
2944,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He was gaunt and shagged , with a ewe neck , and a head like a hammer ; his rusty mane and tail were tangled and knotted with burs ; one eye had lost its pupil , and was glaring and spectral , but the other had the gleam of a genuine devil in it ."
2945,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Still he must have had fire and mettle in his day , if we may judge from the name he bore of Gunpowder ."
2946,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He had , in fact , been a favorite steed of his master 's , the choleric Van Ripper , who was a furious rider , and had infused , very probably , some of his own spirit into the animal ; for , old and broken-down as he looked , there was more of the lurking devil in him than in any young filly in the country ."
2947,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,Ichabod was a suitable figure for such a steed .
2948,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He rode with short stirrups , which brought his knees nearly up to the pommel of the saddle ; his sharp elbows stuck out like grasshoppers ' ; he carried his whip perpendicularly in his hand , like a sceptre , and as his horse jogged on , the motion of his arms was not unlike the flapping of a pair of wings ."
2949,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"A small wool hat rested on the top of his nose , for so his scanty strip of forehead might be called , and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out almost to the horses tail ."
2950,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Such was the appearance of Ichabod and his steed as they shambled out of the gate of Hans Van Ripper , and it was altogether such an apparition as is seldom to be met with in broad daylight ."
2951,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It was , as I have said , a fine autumnal day ; the sky was clear and serene , and nature wore that rich and golden livery which we always associate with the idea of abundance ."
2952,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The forests had put on their sober brown and yellow , while some trees of the tenderer kind had been nipped by the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange , purple , and scarlet ."
2953,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Streaming files of wild ducks began to make their appearance high in the air ; the bark of the squirrel might be heard from the groves of beech and hickory-nuts , and the pensive whistle of the quail at intervals from the neighboring stubble field ."
2954,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,The small birds were taking their farewell banquets .
2955,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"In the fullness of their revelry , they fluttered , chirping and frolicking from bush to bush , and tree to tree , capricious from the very profusion and variety around them ."
2956,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"There was the honest cock robin , the favorite game of stripling sportsmen , with its loud querulous note ; and the twittering blackbirds flying in sable clouds ; and the golden-winged woodpecker with his crimson crest , his broad black gorget , and splendid plumage ; and the cedar bird , with its red-tipt wings and yellow-tipt tail and its little monteiro cap of feathers ; and the blue jay , that noisy coxcomb , in his gay light blue coat and white underclothes , screaming and chattering , nodding and bobbing and bowing , and pretending to be on good terms with every songster of the grove ."
2957,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"As Ichabod jogged slowly on his way , his eye , ever open to every symptom of culinary abundance , ranged with delight over the treasures of jolly autumn ."
2958,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,On all sides he beheld vast store of apples ; some hanging in oppressive opulence on the trees ; some gathered into baskets and barrels for the market ; others heaped up in rich piles for the cider-press .
2959,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Farther on he beheld great fields of Indian corn , with its golden ears peeping from their leafy coverts , and holding out the promise of cakes and hasty-pudding ; and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them , turning up their fair round bellies to the sun , and giving ample prospects of the most luxurious of pies ; and anon he passed the fragrant buckwheat fields breathing the odor of the beehive , and as he beheld them , soft anticipations stole over his mind of dainty slapjacks , well buttered , and garnished with honey or treacle , by the delicate little dimpled hand of Katrina Van Tassel ."
2960,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Thus feeding his mind with many sweet thoughts and `` sugared suppositions , '' he journeyed along the sides of a range of hills which look out upon some of the goodliest scenes of the mighty Hudson ."
2961,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,The sun gradually wheeled his broad disk down in the west .
2962,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The wide bosom of the Tappan Zee lay motionless and glassy , excepting that here and there a gentle undulation waved and prolonged the blue shadow of the distant mountain ."
2963,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"A few amber clouds floated in the sky , without a breath of air to move them ."
2964,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The horizon was of a fine golden tint , changing gradually into a pure apple green , and from that into the deep blue of the mid-heaven ."
2965,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"A slanting ray lingered on the woody crests of the precipices that overhung some parts of the river , giving greater depth to the dark gray and purple of their rocky sides ."
2966,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"A sloop was loitering in the distance , dropping slowly down with the tide , her sail hanging uselessly against the mast ; and as the reflection of the sky gleamed along the still water , it seemed as if the vessel was suspended in the air ."
2967,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It was toward evening that Ichabod arrived at the castle of the Heer Van Tassel , which he found thronged with the pride and flower of the adjacent country ."
2968,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Old farmers , a spare leathern-faced race , in homespun coats and breeches , blue stockings , huge shoes , and magnificent pewter buckles ."
2969,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Their brisk , withered little dames , in close-crimped caps , long-waisted short gowns , homespun petticoats , with scissors and pincushions , and gay calico pockets hanging on the outside ."
2970,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Buxom lasses , almost as antiquated as their mothers , excepting where a straw hat , a fine ribbon , or perhaps a white frock , gave symptoms of city innovation ."
2971,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The sons , in short square-skirted coats , with rows of stupendous brass buttons , and their hair generally queued in the fashion of the times , especially if they could procure an eel-skin for the purpose , it being esteemed throughout the country as a potent nourisher and strengthener of the hair ."
2972,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Brom Bones , however , was the hero of the scene , having come to the gathering on his favorite steed Daredevil , a creature , like himself , full of mettle and mischief , and which no one but himself could manage ."
2973,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He was , in fact , noted for preferring vicious animals , given to all kinds of tricks which kept the rider in constant risk of his neck , for he held a tractable , well-broken horse as unworthy of a lad of spirit ."
2974,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Fain would I pause to dwell upon the world of charms that burst upon the enraptured gaze of my hero , as he entered the state parlor of Van Tassel 's mansion ."
2975,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Not those of the bevy of buxom lasses , with their luxurious display of red and white ; but the ample charms of a genuine Dutch country tea-table , in the sumptuous time of autumn ."
2976,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Such heaped up platters of cakes of various and almost indescribable kinds , known only to experienced Dutch housewives !"
2977,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"There was the doughty doughnut , the tender oly koek , and the crisp and crumbling cruller ; sweet cakes and short cakes , ginger cakes and honey cakes , and the whole family of cakes ."
2978,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"And then there were apple pies , and peach pies , and pumpkin pies ; besides slices of ham and smoked beef ; and moreover delectable dishes of preserved plums , and peaches , and pears , and quinces ; not to mention broiled shad and roasted chickens ; together with bowls of milk and cream , all mingled higgledy-piggledy , pretty much as I have enumerated them , with the motherly teapot sending up its clouds of vapor from the midst -- Heaven bless the mark !"
2979,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"I want breath and time to discuss this banquet as it deserves , and am too eager to get on with my story ."
2980,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Happily , Ichabod Crane was not in so great a hurry as his historian , but did ample justice to every dainty ."
2981,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He was a kind and thankful creature , whose heart dilated in proportion as his skin was filled with good cheer , and whose spirits rose with eating , as some men 's do with drink ."
2982,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He could not help , too , rolling his large eyes round him as he ate , and chuckling with the possibility that he might one day be lord of all this scene of almost unimaginable luxury and splendor ."
2983,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Then , he thought , how soon he 'd turn his back upon the old schoolhouse ; snap his fingers in the face of Hans Van Ripper , and every other niggardly patron , and kick any itinerant pedagogue out of doors that should dare to call him comrade !"
2984,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Old Baltus Van Tassel moved about among his guests with a face dilated with content and good humor , round and jolly as the harvest moon ."
2985,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"His hospitable attentions were brief , but expressive , being confined to a shake of the hand , a slap on the shoulder , a loud laugh , and a pressing invitation to `` fall to , and help themselves . ''"
2986,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"And now the sound of the music from the common room , or hall , summoned to the dance ."
2987,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The musician was an old gray-headed negro , who had been the itinerant orchestra of the neighborhood for more than half a century ."
2988,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,His instrument was as old and battered as himself .
2989,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The greater part of the time he scraped on two or three strings , accompanying every movement of the bow with a motion of the head ; bowing almost to the ground , and stamping with his foot whenever a fresh couple were to start ."
2990,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,Ichabod prided himself upon his dancing as much as upon his vocal powers .
2991,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Not a limb , not a fibre about him was idle ; and to have seen his loosely hung frame in full motion , and clattering about the room , you would have thought St. Vitus himself , that blessed patron of the dance , was figuring before you in person ."
2992,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He was the admiration of all the negroes ; who , having gathered , of all ages and sizes , from the farm and the neighborhood , stood forming a pyramid of shining black faces at every door and window , gazing with delight at the scene , rolling their white eyeballs , and showing grinning rows of ivory from ear to ear ."
2993,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,How could the flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and joyous ?
2994,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The lady of his heart was his partner in the dance , and smiling graciously in reply to all his amorous oglings ; while Brom Bones , sorely smitten with love and jealousy , sat brooding by himself in one corner ."
2995,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"When the dance was at an end , Ichabod was attracted to a knot of the sager folks , who , with Old Van Tassel , sat smoking at one end of the piazza , gossiping over former times , and drawing out long stories about the war ."
2996,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"This neighborhood , at the time of which I am speaking , was one of those highly favored places which abound with chronicle and great men ."
2997,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The British and American line had run near it during the war ; it had , therefore , been the scene of marauding and infested with refugees , cowboys , and all kinds of border chivalry ."
2998,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Just sufficient time had elapsed to enable each storyteller to dress up his tale with a little becoming fiction , and , in the indistinctness of his recollection , to make himself the hero of every exploit ."
2999,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"There was the story of Doffue Martling , a large blue-bearded Dutchman , who had nearly taken a British frigate with an old iron nine-pounder from a mud breastwork , only that his gun burst at the sixth discharge ."
3000,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"And there was an old gentleman who shall be nameless , being too rich a mynheer to be lightly mentioned , who , in the battle of White Plains , being an excellent master of defence , parried a musket-ball with a small sword , insomuch that he absolutely felt it whiz round the blade , and glance off at the hilt ; in proof of which he was ready at any time to show the sword , with the hilt a little bent ."
3001,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"There were several more that had been equally great in the field , not one of whom but was persuaded that he had a considerable hand in bringing the war to a happy termination ."
3002,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,But all these were nothing to the tales of ghosts and apparitions that succeeded .
3003,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,The neighborhood is rich in legendary treasures of the kind .
3004,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Local tales and superstitions thrive best in these sheltered , long-settled retreats ; but are trampled under foot by the shifting throng that forms the population of most of our country places ."
3005,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Besides , there is no encouragement for ghosts in most of our villages , for they have scarcely had time to finish their first nap and turn themselves in their graves , before their surviving friends have travelled away from the neighborhood ; so that when they turn out at night to walk their rounds , they have no acquaintance left to call upon ."
3006,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,This is perhaps the reason why we so seldom hear of ghosts except in our long-established Dutch communities .
3007,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The immediate cause , however , of the prevalence of supernatural stories in these parts , was doubtless owing to the vicinity of Sleepy Hollow ."
3008,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,There was a contagion in the very air that blew from that haunted region ; it breathed forth an atmosphere of dreams and fancies infecting all the land .
3009,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Several of the Sleepy Hollow people were present at Van Tassel 's , and , as usual , were doling out their wild and wonderful legends ."
3010,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Many dismal tales were told about funeral trains , and mourning cries and wailings heard and seen about the great tree where the unfortunate Major Andr was taken , and which stood in the neighborhood ."
3011,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Some mention was made also of the woman in white , that haunted the dark glen at Raven Rock , and was often heard to shriek on winter nights before a storm , having perished there in the snow ."
3012,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The chief part of the stories , however , turned upon the favorite spectre of Sleepy Hollow , the Headless Horseman , who had been heard several times of late , patrolling the country ; and , it was said , tethered his horse nightly among the graves in the churchyard ."
3013,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,The sequestered situation of this church seems always to have made it a favorite haunt of troubled spirits .
3014,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It stands on a knoll , surrounded by locust-trees and lofty elms , from among which its decent , whitewashed walls shine modestly forth , like Christian purity beaming through the shades of retirement ."
3015,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"A gentle slope descends from it to a silver sheet of water , bordered by high trees , between which , peeps may be caught at the blue hills of the Hudson ."
3016,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"To look upon its grass-grown yard , where the sunbeams seem to sleep so quietly , one would think that there at least the dead might rest in peace ."
3017,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"On one side of the church extends a wide woody dell , along which raves a large brook among broken rocks and trunks of fallen trees ."
3018,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Over a deep black part of the stream , not far from the church , was formerly thrown a wooden bridge ; the road that led to it , and the bridge itself , were thickly shaded by overhanging trees , which cast a gloom about it , even in the daytime ; but occasioned a fearful darkness at night ."
3019,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Such was one of the favorite haunts of the Headless Horseman , and the place where he was most frequently encountered ."
3020,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The tale was told of old Brouwer , a most heretical disbeliever in ghosts , how he met the Horseman returning from his foray into Sleepy Hollow , and was obliged to get up behind him ; how they galloped over bush and brake , over hill and swamp , until they reached the bridge ; when the Horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton , threw old Brouwer into the brook , and sprang away over the tree-tops with a clap of thunder ."
3021,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"This story was immediately matched by a thrice marvellous adventure of Brom Bones , who made light of the Galloping Hessian as an arrant jockey ."
3022,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He affirmed that on returning one night from the neighboring village of Sing Sing , he had been overtaken by this midnight trooper ; that he had offered to race with him for a bowl of punch , and should have won it too , for Daredevil beat the goblin horse all hollow , but just as they came to the church bridge , the Hessian bolted , and vanished in a flash of fire ."
3023,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"All these tales , told in that drowsy undertone with which men talk in the dark , the countenances of the listeners only now and then receiving a casual gleam from the glare of a pipe , sank deep in the mind of Ichabod ."
3024,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He repaid them in kind with large extracts from his invaluable author , Cotton Mather , and added many marvellous events that had taken place in his native State of Connecticut , and fearful sights which he had seen in his nightly walks about Sleepy Hollow ."
3025,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,The revel now gradually broke up .
3026,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The old farmers gathered together their families in their wagons , and were heard for some time rattling along the hollow roads , and over the distant hills ."
3027,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Some of the damsels mounted on pillions behind their favorite swains , and their light-hearted laughter , mingling with the clatter of hoofs , echoed along the silent woodlands , sounding fainter and fainter , until they gradually died away , -- and the late scene of noise and frolic was all silent and deserted ."
3028,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Ichabod only lingered behind , according to the custom of country lovers , to have a tte--tte with the heiress ; fully convinced that he was now on the high road to success ."
3029,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"What passed at this interview I will not pretend to say , for in fact I do not know ."
3030,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Something , however , I fear me , must have gone wrong , for he certainly sallied forth , after no very great interval , with an air quite desolate and chapfallen ."
3031,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Oh , these women ! these women !"
3032,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,Could that girl have been playing off any of her coquettish tricks ?
3033,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,Was her encouragement of the poor pedagogue all a mere sham to secure her conquest of his rival ?
3034,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Heaven only knows , not I !"
3035,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Let it suffice to say , Ichabod stole forth with the air of one who had been sacking a henroost , rather than a fair lady 's heart ."
3036,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Without looking to the right or left to notice the scene of rural wealth , on which he had so often gloated , he went straight to the stable , and with several hearty cuffs and kicks roused his steed most uncourteously from the comfortable quarters in which he was soundly sleeping , dreaming of mountains of corn and oats , and whole valleys of timothy and clover ."
3037,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It was the very witching time of night that Ichabod , heavy-hearted and crestfallen , pursued his travels homewards , along the sides of the lofty hills which rise above Tarry Town , and which he had traversed so cheerily in the afternoon ."
3038,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,The hour was as dismal as himself .
3039,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Far below him the Tappan Zee spread its dusky and indistinct waste of waters , with here and there the tall mast of a sloop , riding quietly at anchor under the land ."
3040,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"In the dead hush of midnight , he could even hear the barking of the watchdog from the opposite shore of the Hudson ; but it was so vague and faint as only to give an idea of his distance from this faithful companion of man ."
3041,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Now and then , too , the long-drawn crowing of a cock , accidentally awakened , would sound far , far off , from some farmhouse away among the hills -- but it was like a dreaming sound in his ear ."
3042,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"No signs of life occurred near him , but occasionally the melancholy chirp of a cricket , or perhaps the guttural twang of a bullfrog from a neighboring marsh , as if sleeping uncomfortably and turning suddenly in his bed ."
3043,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,All the stories of ghosts and goblins that he had heard in the afternoon now came crowding upon his recollection .
3044,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The night grew darker and darker ; the stars seemed to sink deeper in the sky , and driving clouds occasionally hid them from his sight ."
3045,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,He had never felt so lonely and dismal .
3046,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He was , moreover , approaching the very place where many of the scenes of the ghost stories had been laid ."
3047,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"In the centre of the road stood an enormous tulip-tree , which towered like a giant above all the other trees of the neighborhood , and formed a kind of landmark ."
3048,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Its limbs were gnarled and fantastic , large enough to form trunks for ordinary trees , twisting down almost to the earth , and rising again into the air ."
3049,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It was connected with the tragical story of the unfortunate Andr , who had been taken prisoner hard by ; and was universally known by the name of Major Andr 's tree ."
3050,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The common people regarded it with a mixture of respect and superstition , partly out of sympathy for the fate of its ill-starred namesake , and partly from the tales of strange sights , and doleful lamentations , told concerning it ."
3051,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"As Ichabod approached this fearful tree , he began to whistle ; he thought his whistle was answered ; it was but a blast sweeping sharply through the dry branches ."
3052,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"As he approached a little nearer , he thought he saw something white , hanging in the midst of the tree : he paused and ceased whistling but , on looking more narrowly , perceived that it was a place where the tree had been scathed by lightning , and the white wood laid bare ."
3053,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Suddenly he heard a groan -- his teeth chattered , and his knees smote against the saddle : it was but the rubbing of one huge bough upon another , as they were swayed about by the breeze ."
3054,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He passed the tree in safety , but new perils lay before him ."
3055,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"About two hundred yards from the tree , a small brook crossed the road , and ran into a marshy and thickly-wooded glen , known by the name of Wiley 's Swamp ."
3056,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"A few rough logs , laid side by side , served for a bridge over this stream ."
3057,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"On that side of the road where the brook entered the wood , a group of oaks and chestnuts , matted thick with wild grape-vines , threw a cavernous gloom over it ."
3058,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,To pass this bridge was the severest trial .
3059,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It was at this identical spot that the unfortunate Andr was captured , and under the covert of those chestnuts and vines were the sturdy yeomen concealed who surprised him ."
3060,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"This has ever since been considered a haunted stream , and fearful are the feelings of the schoolboy who has to pass it alone after dark ."
3061,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"As he approached the stream , his heart began to thump ; he summoned up , however , all his resolution , gave his horse half a score of kicks in the ribs , and attempted to dash briskly across the bridge ; but instead of starting forward , the perverse old animal made a lateral movement , and ran broadside against the fence ."
3062,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Ichabod , whose fears increased with the delay , jerked the reins on the other side , and kicked lustily with the contrary foot : it was all in vain ; his steed started , it is true , but it was only to plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of brambles and alder bushes ."
3063,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and heel upon the starveling ribs of old Gunpowder , who dashed forward , snuffling and snorting , but came to a stand just by the bridge , with a suddenness that had nearly sent his rider sprawling over his head ."
3064,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,Just at this moment a plashy tramp by the side of the bridge caught the sensitive ear of Ichabod .
3065,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"In the dark shadow of the grove , on the margin of the brook , he beheld something huge , misshapen and towering ."
3066,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It stirred not , but seemed gathered up in the gloom , like some gigantic monster ready to spring upon the traveller ."
3067,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,The hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his head with terror .
3068,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,What was to be done ?
3069,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"To turn and fly was now too late ; and besides , what chance was there of escaping ghost or goblin , if such it was , which could ride upon the wings of the wind ?"
3070,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Summoning up , therefore , a show of courage , he demanded in stammering accents , `` Who are you ? ''"
3071,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,He received no reply .
3072,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,He repeated his demand in a still more agitated voice .
3073,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,Still there was no answer .
3074,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Once more he cudgelled the sides of the inflexible Gunpowder , and , shutting his eyes , broke forth with involuntary fervor into a psalm tune ."
3075,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Just then the shadowy object of alarm put itself in motion , and with a scramble and a bound stood at once in the middle of the road ."
3076,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Though the night was dark and dismal , yet the form of the unknown might now in some degree be ascertained ."
3077,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions , and mounted on a black horse of powerful frame ."
3078,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He made no offer of molestation or sociability , but kept aloof on one side of the road , jogging along on the blind side of old Gunpowder , who had now got over his fright and waywardness ."
3079,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Ichabod , who had no relish for this strange midnight companion , and bethought himself of the adventure of Brom Bones with the Galloping Hessian , now quickened his steed in hopes of leaving him behind ."
3080,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The stranger , however , quickened his horse to an equal pace ."
3081,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Ichabod pulled up , and fell into a walk , thinking to lag behind , -- the other did the same ."
3082,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"His heart began to sink within him ; he endeavored to resume his psalm tune , but his parched tongue clove to the roof of his mouth , and he could not utter a stave ."
3083,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,There was something in the moody and dogged silence of this pertinacious companion that was mysterious and appalling .
3084,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,It was soon fearfully accounted for .
3085,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"On mounting a rising ground , which brought the figure of his fellow-traveller in relief against the sky , gigantic in height , and muffled in a cloak , Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless ! -- but his horror was still more increased on observing that the head , which should have rested on his shoulders , was carried before him on the pommel of his saddle !"
3086,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"His terror rose to desperation ; he rained a shower of kicks and blows upon Gunpowder , hoping by a sudden movement to give his companion the slip ; but the spectre started full jump with him ."
3087,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Away , then , they dashed through thick and thin ; stones flying and sparks flashing at every bound ."
3088,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Ichabod 's flimsy garments fluttered in the air , as he stretched his long lank body away over his horse 's head , in the eagerness of his flight ."
3089,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"They had now reached the road which turns off to Sleepy Hollow ; but Gunpowder , who seemed possessed with a demon , instead of keeping up it , made an opposite turn , and plunged headlong downhill to the left ."
3090,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"This road leads through a sandy hollow shaded by trees for about a quarter of a mile , where it crosses the bridge famous in goblin story ; and just beyond swells the green knoll on which stands the whitewashed church ."
3091,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"As yet the panic of the steed had given his unskilful rider an apparent advantage in the chase , but just as he had got half way through the hollow , the girths of the saddle gave way , and he felt it slipping from under him ."
3092,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"He seized it by the pommel , and endeavored to hold it firm , but in vain ; and had just time to save himself by clasping old Gunpowder round the neck , when the saddle fell to the earth , and he heard it trampled under foot by his pursuer ."
3093,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"For a moment the terror of Hans Van Ripper 's wrath passed across his mind , -- for it was his Sunday saddle ; but this was no time for petty fears ; the goblin was hard on his haunches ; and unskilful rider that he was ! -RRB- he had much ado to maintain his seat ; sometimes slipping on one side , sometimes on another , and sometimes jolted on the high ridge of his horse 's backbone , with a violence that he verily feared would cleave him asunder ."
3094,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,An opening in the trees now cheered him with the hopes that the church bridge was at hand .
3095,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,The wavering reflection of a silver star in the bosom of the brook told him that he was not mistaken .
3096,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,He saw the walls of the church dimly glaring under the trees beyond .
3097,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,He recollected the place where Brom Bones 's ghostly competitor had disappeared .
3098,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"`` If I can but reach that bridge , '' thought Ichabod , `` I am safe . ''"
3099,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,Just then he heard the black steed panting and blowing close behind him ; he even fancied that he felt his hot breath .
3100,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Another convulsive kick in the ribs , and old Gunpowder sprang upon the bridge ; he thundered over the resounding planks ; he gained the opposite side ; and now Ichabod cast a look behind to see if his pursuer should vanish , according to rule , in a flash of fire and brimstone ."
3101,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Just then he saw the goblin rising in his stirrups , and in the very act of hurling his head at him ."
3102,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Ichabod endeavored to dodge the horrible missile , but too late ."
3103,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It encountered his cranium with a tremendous crash , -- he was tumbled headlong into the dust , and Gunpowder , the black steed , and the goblin rider , passed by like a whirlwind ."
3104,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The next morning the old horse was found without his saddle , and with the bridle under his feet , soberly cropping the grass at his master 's gate ."
3105,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Ichabod did not make his appearance at breakfast ; dinner-hour came , but no Ichabod ."
3106,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The boys assembled at the schoolhouse , and strolled idly about the banks of the brook ; but no schoolmaster ."
3107,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Hans Van Ripper now began to feel some uneasiness about the fate of poor Ichabod , and his saddle ."
3108,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"An inquiry was set on foot , and after diligent investigation they came upon his traces ."
3109,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"In one part of the road leading to the church was found the saddle trampled in the dirt ; the tracks of horses ' hoofs deeply dented in the road , and evidently at furious speed , were traced to the bridge , beyond which , on the bank of a broad part of the brook , where the water ran deep and black , was found the hat of the unfortunate Ichabod , and close beside it a shattered pumpkin ."
3110,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The brook was searched , but the body of the schoolmaster was not to be discovered ."
3111,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Hans Van Ripper as executor of his estate , examined the bundle which contained all his worldly effects ."
3112,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,They consisted of two shirts and a half ; two stocks for the neck ; a pair or two of worsted stockings ; an old pair of corduroy small-clothes ; a rusty razor ; a book of psalm tunes full of dog 's - ears ; and a broken pitch-pipe .
3113,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"As to the books and furniture of the schoolhouse , they belonged to the community , excepting Cotton Mather 's `` History of Witchcraft , '' a `` New England Almanac , '' and a book of dreams and fortune-telling ; in which last was a sheet of foolscap much scribbled and blotted in several fruitless attempts to make a copy of verses in honor of the heiress of Van Tassel ."
3114,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"These magic books and the poetic scrawl were forthwith consigned to the flames by Hans Van Ripper ; who , from that time forward , determined to send his children no more to school , observing that he never knew any good come of this same reading and writing ."
3115,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Whatever money the schoolmaster possessed , and he had received his quarter 's pay but a day or two before , he must have had about his person at the time of his disappearance ."
3116,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,The mysterious event caused much speculation at the church on the following Sunday .
3117,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"Knots of gazers and gossips were collected in the churchyard , at the bridge , and at the spot where the hat and pumpkin had been found ."
3118,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The stories of Brouwer , of Bones , and a whole budget of others were called to mind ; and when they had diligently considered them all , and compared them with the symptoms of the present case , they shook their heads , and came to the conclusion that Ichabod had been carried off by the Galloping Hessian ."
3119,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"As he was a bachelor , and in nobody 's debt , nobody troubled his head any more about him ; the school was removed to a different quarter of the hollow , and another pedagogue reigned in his stead ."
3120,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"It is true , an old farmer , who had been down to New York on a visit several years after , and from whom this account of the ghostly adventure was received , brought home the intelligence that Ichabod Crane was still alive ; that he had left the neighborhood partly through fear of the goblin and Hans Van Ripper , and partly in mortification at having been suddenly dismissed by the heiress ; that he had changed his quarters to a distant part of the country ; had kept school and studied law at the same time ; had been admitted to the bar ; turned politician ; electioneered ; written for the newspapers ; and finally had been made a justice of the Ten Pound Court ."

3124,Washington Irving,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,"The schoolhouse being deserted soon fell to decay , and was reported to be haunted by the ghost of the unfortunate pedagogue and the plowboy , loitering homeward of a still summer evening , has often fancied his voice at a distance , chanting a melancholy psalm tune among the tranquil solitudes of Sleepy Hollow ."
