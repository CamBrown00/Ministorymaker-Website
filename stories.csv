"With almost everything else to make them happy , they wanted one thing : they had no children .
This vexed the king even more than the queen , who was very clever and learned , and who had hated dolls when she was a child .
However , she , too in spite of all the books she read and all the pictures she painted , would have been glad enough to be the mother of a little prince .
The king was anxious to consult the fairies , but the queen would not hear of such a thing .
She did not believe in fairies : she said that they had never existed ; and that she maintained , though The History of the Royal Family was full of chapters about nothing else .
Well , at long and at last they had a little boy , who was generally regarded as the finest baby that had ever been seen .
Even her majesty herself remarked that , though she could never believe all the courtiers told her , yet he certainly was a fine child -- a very fine child .
Now , the time drew near for the christening party , and the king and queen were sitting at breakfast in their summer parlour talking over it .
It was a splendid room , hung with portraits of the royal ancestors .
There was Cinderella , the grandmother of the reigning monarch , with her little foot in her glass slipper thrust out before her .
There was the Marquis de Carabas , who , as everyone knows , was raised to the throne as prince consort after his marriage with the daughter of the king of the period .
On the arm of the throne was seated his celebrated cat , wearing boots .
There , too , was a portrait of a beautiful lady , sound asleep : this was Madame La Belle au Bois-dormant , also an ancestress of the royal family .
Many other pictures of celebrated persons were hanging on the walls .
`` You have asked all the right people , my dear ? '' said the king .
`` Everyone who should be asked , '' answered the queen .
`` People are so touchy on these occasions , '' said his majesty .
`` You have not forgotten any of our aunts ? ''
`` No ; the old cats ! '' replied the queen ; for the king 's aunts were old-fashioned , and did not approve of her , and she knew it .
`` They are very kind old ladies in their way , '' said the king ; `` and were nice to me when I was a boy . ''
Then he waited a little , and remarked : `` The fairies , of course , you have invited ?
It has always been usual , in our family , on an occasion like this ; and I think we have neglected them a little of late . ''
`` How can you be so absurd ? '' cried the queen .
`` How often must I tell you that there are no fairies ?
And even if there were -- but , no matter ; pray let us drop the subject . ''
`` They are very old friends of our family , my dear , that 's all , '' said the king timidly .
`` Often and often they have been godmothers to us .
One , in particular , was most kind and most serviceable to Cinderella I. , my own grandmother . ''
`` Your grandmother ! '' interrupted her majesty .
`` Fiddle-de-dee !
If anyone puts such nonsense into the head of my little Prigio -- '' But here the baby was brought in by the nurse , and the queen almost devoured it with kisses .
And so the fairies were not invited !
It was an extraordinary thing , but none of the nobles could come to the christening party when they learned that the fairies had not been asked .
Some were abroad ; several were ill ; a few were in prison among the Saracens ; others were captives in the dens of ogres .
The end of it was that the king and queen had to sit down alone , one at each end of a very long table , arrayed with plates and glasses for a hundred guests -- for a hundred guests who never came !
`` Any soup , my dear ? '' shouted the king , through a speaking-trumpet ; when , suddenly , the air was filled with a sound like the rustling of the wings of birds .
Flitter , flitter , flutter , went the noise ; and when the queen looked up , lo and behold ! on every seat was a lovely fairy , dressed in green , each with a most interesting-looking parcel in her hand .
Do n't you like opening parcels ?
The king did , and he was most friendly and polite to the fairies .
But the queen , though she saw them distinctly , took no notice of them .
You see , she did not believe in fairies , nor in her own eyes , when she saw them .
So she talked across the fairies to the king , just as if they had not been there ; but the king behaved as politely as if they were real -- which , of course , they were .
When dinner was over , and when the nurse had brought in the baby , all the fairies gave him the most magnificent presents .
One offered a purse which could never be empty ; and one a pair of seven-leagued boots ; and another a cap of darkness , that nobody might see the prince when he put it on ; and another a wishing-cap ; and another a carpet , on which , when he sat , he was carried wherever he wished to find himself .
Another made him beautiful for ever ; and another , brave ; and another , lucky : but the last fairy of all , a cross old thing , crept up and said , `` My child , you shall be too clever ! ''
This fairy 's gift would have pleased the queen , if she had believed in it , more than anything else , because she was so clever herself .
But she took no notice at all ; and the fairies went each to her own country , and none of them stayed there at the palace , where nobody believed in them , except the king , a little .
But the queen tossed all their nice boots and caps , carpets , purses , swords , and all , away into a dark lumber-room ; for , of course , she thought that they were all nonsense , and merely old rubbish out of books , or pantomime `` properties . ''
Well , the little prince grew up .
I think I 've told you that his name was Prigio -- did I not ?
Well , that was his name .
You can not think how clever he was .
He argued with his nurse as soon as he could speak , which was very soon .
He argued that he did not like to be washed , because the soap got into his eyes .
However , when he was told all about the pores of the skin , and how they could not be healthy if he was not washed , he at once ceased to resist , for he was very reasonable .
He argued with his father that he did not see why there should be kings who were rich , while beggars were poor ; and why the king -- who was a little greedy -- should have poached eggs and plum-cake at afternoon tea , while many other persons went without dinner .
The king was so surprised and hurt at these remarks that he boxed the prince 's ears , saying , `` I 'll teach you to be too clever , my lad . ''
Then he remembered the awful curse of the oldest fairy , and was sorry for the rudeness of the queen .
And when the prince , after having his ears boxed , said that `` force was no argument , '' the king went away in a rage .
Indeed , I can not tell you how the prince was hated by all !
He would go down into the kitchen , and show the cook how to make soup .
He would visit the poor people 's cottage , and teach them how to make the beds , and how to make plum-pudding out of turnip-tops , and venison cutlets out of rusty bacon .
He showed the fencing-master how to fence , and the professional cricketer how to bowl , and instructed the rat-catcher in breeding terriers .
He set sums to the Chancellor of the Exchequer , and assured the Astronomer Royal that the sun does not go round the earth -- which , for my part , I believe it does .
The young ladies of the Court disliked dancing with him , in spite of his good looks , because he was always asking , `` Have you read this ? '' and `` Have you read that ? '' -- and when they said they had n't , he sneered ; and when they said they had , he found them out .
He found out all his tutors and masters in the same horrid way ; correcting the accent of his French teacher , and trying to get his German tutor not to eat peas with his knife .
He also endeavoured to teach the queen-dowager , his grandmother , an art with which she had long been perfectly familiar !
In fact , he knew everything better than anybody else ; and the worst of it was that he did : and he was never in the wrong , and he always said , `` Did n't I tell you so ? ''
And , what was more , he had !
As time went on , Prince Prigio had two younger brothers , whom everybody liked .
They were not a bit clever , but jolly .
Prince Alphonso , the third son , was round , fat , good-humoured , and as brave as a lion .
Prince Enrico , the second , was tall , thin , and a little sad , but never too clever .
Both were in love with two of their own cousins with the approval of their dear parents ; and all the world said , `` What nice , unaffected princes they are ! ''
But Prigio nearly got the country into several wars by being too clever for the foreign ambassadors .
Now , as Pantouflia was a rich , lazy country , which hated fighting , this was very unpleasant , and did not make people love Prince Prigio any better .
Of all the people who did not like Prigio , his own dear papa , King Grognio , disliked him most .
For the king knew he was not clever , himself .
When he was in the counting-house , counting out his money , and when he happened to say , `` Sixteen shillings and fourteen and twopence are three pounds , fifteen , '' it made him wild to hear Prigio whisper , `` One pound , ten and twopence '' -- which , of course , it is .
And the king was afraid that Prigio would conspire , and get made king himself -- which was the last thing Prigio really wanted .
He much preferred to idle about , and know everything without seeming to take any trouble .
Well , the king thought and thought .
How was he to get Prigio out of the way , and make Enrico or Alphonso his successor ?
He read in books about it ; and all the books showed that , if a king sent his three sons to do anything , it was always the youngest who did it , and got the crown .
And he wished he had the chance .
Well , it arrived at last .
There was a very hot summer !
It began to be hot in March .
All the rivers were dried up .
The grass did not grow .
The corn did not grow .
The thermometers exploded with heat .
The barometers stood at SET FAIR .
The people were much distressed , and came and broke the palace windows -- as they usually do when things go wrong in Pantouflia .
The king consulted the learned men about the Court , who told him that probably a FIREDRAKE was in the neighbourhood .
Now , the Firedrake is a beast , or bird , about the bigness of an elephant .
Its body is made of iron , and it is always red-hot .
A more terrible and cruel beast can not be imagined ; for , if you go near it , you are at once broiled by the Firedrake .
But the king was not ill-pleased : `` for , '' thought he , `` of course my three sons must go after the brute , the eldest first ; and , as usual , it will kill the first two , and be beaten by the youngest .
It is a little hard on Enrico , poor boy ; but anything to get rid of that Prigio ! ''
Then the king went to Prigio , and said that his country was in danger , and that he was determined to leave the crown to whichever of them would bring him the horns for it has horns and tail of the Firedrake .
`` It is an awkward brute to tackle , '' the king said , `` but you are the oldest , my lad ; go where glory waits you !
Put on your armour , and be off with you ! ''
 `` Put on your armour and be off with you ! ''
: p18.jpg -RCB- This the king said , hoping that either the Firedrake would roast Prince Prigio alive which he could easily do , as I have said ; for he is all over as hot as a red-hot poker , or that , if the prince succeeded , at least his country would be freed from the monster .
But the prince , who was lying on the sofa doing sums in compound division for fun , said in the politest way : `` Thanks to the education your majesty has given me , I have learned that the Firedrake , like the siren , the fairy , and so forth , is a fabulous animal which does not exist .
But even granting , for the sake of argument , that there is a Firedrake , your majesty is well aware that there is no kind of use in sending me .
It is always the eldest son who goes out first and comes to grief on these occasions , and it is always the third son that succeeds .
Send Alphonso '' this was the youngest brother , `` and he will do the trick at once .
At least , if he fails , it will be most unusual , and Enrico can try his luck . ''
Then he went back to his arithmetic and his slate , and the king had to send for Prince Alphonso and Prince Enrico .
They both came in very warm ; for they had been whipping tops , and the day was unusually hot .
`` Look here , '' said the king , `` just you two younger ones look at Prigio !
You see how hot it is , and how coolly he takes it , and the country suffering ; and all on account of a Firedrake , you know , which has apparently built his nest not far off .
Well , I have asked that lout of a brother of yours to kill it , and he says -- '' `` That he does not believe in Firedrakes , '' interrupted Prigio .
`` The weather 's warm enough without going out hunting ! ''
`` Not believe in Firedrakes ! '' cried Alphonso .
`` I wonder what you do believe in !
Just let me get at the creature ! '' for he was as brave as a lion .
`` Hi !
Page , my chain-armour , helmet , lance , and buckler !
A Molinda !
A Molinda ! '' which was his war-cry .
The page ran to get the armour ; but it was so uncommonly hot that he dropped it , and put his fingers in his mouth , crying !
`` You had better put on flannels , Alphonso , for this kind of work , '' said Prigio .
`` And if I were you , I 'd take a light garden-engine , full of water , to squirt at the enemy . ''
`` Happy thought ! '' said Alphonso .
`` I will ! ''
And off he went , kissed his dear Molinda , bade her keep a lot of dances for him there was to be a dance when he had killed the Firedrake , and then he rushed to the field !
But he never came back any more !
Everyone wept bitterly -- everyone but Prince Prigio ; for he thought it was a practical joke , and said that Alphonso had taken the opportunity to start off on his travels and see the world .
`` There is some dreadful mistake , sir , '' said Prigio to the king .
`` You know as well as I do that the youngest son has always succeeded , up to now .
But I entertain great hopes of Enrico ! ''
And he grinned ; for he fancied it was all nonsense , and that there were no Firedrakes .
Enrico was present when Prigio was consoling the king in this unfeeling way .
`` Enrico , my boy , '' said his majesty , `` the task awaits you , and the honour .
When you come back with the horns and tail of the Firedrake , you shall be crown prince ; and Prigio shall be made an usher at the Grammar School -- it is all he is fit for . ''
Enrico was not quite so confident as Alphonso had been .
He insisted on making his will ; and he wrote a poem about the pleasures and advantages of dying young .
This is part of it : The violet is a blossom sweet , That droops before the day is done -- Slain by thine overpowering heat , O Sun !
And I , like that sweet purple flower , May roast , or boil , or broil , or bake , If burned by thy terrific power , Firedrake !
This poem comforted Enrico more or less , and he showed it to Prigio .
But the prince only laughed , and said that the second line of the last verse was not very good ; for violets do not `` roast , or boil , or broil , or bake . ''
Enrico tried to improve it , but could not .
So he read it to his cousin , Lady Kathleena , just as it was ; and she cried over it though I do n't think she understood it ; and Enrico cried a little , too .
However , next day he started , with a spear , a patent refrigerator , and a lot of the bottles people throw at fires to put them out .
But he never came back again !
After shedding torrents of tears , the king summoned Prince Prigio to his presence .
`` Dastard ! '' he said .
`` Poltroon !
Your turn , which should have come first , has arrived at last .
You must fetch me the horns and the tail of the Firedrake .
Probably you will be grilled , thank goodness ; but who will give me back Enrico and Alphonso ? ''
`` Indeed , your majesty , '' said Prigio , `` you must permit me to correct your policy .
Your only reason for dispatching your sons in pursuit of this dangerous but I believe fabulous animal , was to ascertain which of us would most worthily succeed to your throne , at the date -- long may it be deferred ! -- of your lamented decease .
Now , there can be no further question about the matter .
I , unworthy as I am , represent the sole hope of the royal family .
Therefore to send me after the Firedrake were both dangerous and unnecessary .
Dangerous , because , if he treats me as you say he did my brothers -- my unhappy brothers , -- the throne of Pantouflia will want an heir .
But , if I do come back alive -- why , I can not be more the true heir than I am at present ; now can I ?
Ask the Lord Chief Justice , if you do n't believe me . ''
These arguments were so clearly and undeniably correct that the king , unable to answer them , withdrew into a solitary place where he could express himself with freedom , and give rein to his expression .
Meanwhile , Prince Prigio had to suffer many unpleasant things .
Though he was the crown prince and though his arguments were unanswerable , everybody shunned him for a coward .
The queen , who did not believe in Firedrakes , alone took his side .
He was not only avoided by all , but he had most disagreeable scenes with his own cousins , Lady Molinda and Lady Kathleena .
In the garden Lady Molinda met him walking alone , and did not bow to him .
`` Dear Molly , '' said the prince , who liked her , `` how have I been so unfortunate as to offend you ? ''
`` My name , sir , is Lady Molinda , '' she said , very proudly ; `` and you have sent your own brother to his grave ! ''
`` Oh , excuse me , '' said the prince , `` I am certain he has merely gone off on his travels .
He 'll come back when he 's tired : there are no Firedrakes ; a French writer says they are ` purement fabuleux , ' purely fabulous , you know . ''
 `` My name , sir , is Lady Molinda , she said . ''
: p29.jpg -RCB- `` Prince Alphonso has gone on his travels , and will come back when he is tired !
And was he then -- tired -- of me ? '' cried poor Molinda , bursting into tears , and forgetting her dignity .
`` Oh !
I beg your pardon , I never noticed ; I 'm sure I am very sorry , '' cried the prince , who , never having been in love himself , never thought of other people .
And he tried to take Molinda 's hand , but she snatched it from him and ran away through the garden to the palace , leaving Prince Prigio to feel foolish , for once , and ashamed .
As for Lady Kathleena , she swept past him like a queen , without a word .
So the prince , for all his cleverness , was not happy .
After several days had gone by , the king returned from the solitary place where he had been speaking his mind .
He now felt calmer and better ; and so at last he came back to the palace .
But on seeing Prince Prigio , who was lolling in a hammock , translating Egyptian hieroglyphs into French poetry for his mother , the king broke out afresh , and made use of the most cruel and impolite expressions .
At last , he gave orders that all the Court should pack up and move to a distant city ; and that Prince Prigio should be left alone in the palace by himself .
For he was quite unendurable , the king said , and he could not trust his own temper when he thought of him .
And he grew so fierce , that even the queen was afraid of him now .
The poor queen cried a good deal ; Prigio being her favourite son , on account of his acknowledged ability and talent .
But the rest of the courtiers were delighted at leaving Prince Prigio behind .
For his part , he , very good-naturedly , showed them the best and shortest road to Falkenstein , the city where they were going ; and easily proved that neither the chief secretary for geography , nor the general of the army , knew anything about the matter -- which , indeed , they did not .
The ungrateful courtiers left Prigio with hoots and yells , for they disliked him so much that they forgot he would be king one day .
He therefore reminded them of this little fact in future history , which made them feel uncomfortable enough , and then lay down in his hammock and went to sleep .
When he wakened , the air was cold and the day was beginning to grow dark .
Prince Prigio thought he would go down and dine at a tavern in the town , for no servants had been left with him .
But what was his annoyance when he found that his boots , his sword , his cap , his cloak -- all his clothes , in fact , except those he wore , -- had been taken away by the courtiers , merely to spite him !
His wardrobe had been ransacked , and everything that had not been carried off had been cut up , burned , and destroyed .
Never was such a spectacle of wicked mischief .
It was as if hay had been made of everything he possessed .
What was worse , he had not a penny in his pocket to buy new things ; and his father had stopped his allowance of fifty thousand pounds a month .
Can you imagine anything more cruel and unjust than this conduct ? for it was not the prince 's fault that he was so clever .
The cruel fairy had made him so .
But , even if the prince had been born clever as may have happened to you , was he to be blamed for that ?
The other people were just as much in fault for being born so stupid ; but the world , my dear children , can never be induced to remember this .
If you are clever , you will find it best not to let people know it -- if you want them to like you .
Well , here was the prince in a pretty plight .
Not a pound in his pocket , not a pair of boots to wear , not even a cap to cover his head from the rain ; nothing but cold meat to eat , and never a servant to answer the bell .
At last he climbed up a turret-stair in the very oldest part of the castle , where he had never been before ; and at the very top was a little round room , a kind of garret .
The prince pushed in the door with some difficulty -- not that it was locked , but the handle was rusty , and the wood had swollen with the damp .
The room was very dark ; only the last grey light of the rainy evening came through a slit of a window , one of those narrow windows that they used to fire arrows out of in old times .
But in the dusk the prince saw a heap of all sorts of things lying on the floor and on the table .
There were two caps ; he put one on -- an old , grey , ugly cap it was , made of felt .
There was a pair of boots ; and he kicked off his slippers , and got into them .
They were a good deal worn , but fitted as if they had been made for him .
On the table was a purse with just three gold coins -- old ones , too -- in it ; and this , as you may fancy , the prince was very well pleased to put in his pocket .
A sword , with a sword-belt , he buckled about his waist ; and the rest of the articles , a regular collection of odds and ends , he left just where they were lying .
Then he ran downstairs , and walked out of the hall door .
By this time the prince was very hungry .
The town was just three miles off ; but he had such a royal appetite , that he did not like to waste it on bad cookery , and the people of the royal town were bad cooks .
`` I wish I were in ` The Bear , ' at Gluckstein , '' said he to himself ; for he remembered that there was a very good cook there .
But , then , the town was twenty-one leagues away -- sixty-three long miles !
No sooner had the prince said this , and taken just three steps , than he found himself at the door of the `` Bear Inn '' at Gluckstein !
`` This is the most extraordinary dream , '' said he to himself ; for he was far too clever , of course , to believe in seven-league boots .
Yet he had a pair on at that very moment , and it was they which had carried him in three strides from the palace to Gluckstein !
The truth is , that the prince , in looking about the palace for clothes , had found his way into that very old lumber-room where the magical gifts of the fairies had been thrown by his clever mother , who did not believe in them .
But this , of course , the prince did not know .
Now you should be told that seven-league boots only take those prodigious steps when you say you want to go a long distance .
Otherwise they would be very inconvenient -- when you only want to cross the room , for example .
Perhaps this has not been explained to you by your governess ?
Well , the prince walked into `` The Bear , '' and it seemed odd to him that nobody took any notice of him .
And yet his face was as well known as that of any man in Pantouflia , for everybody had seen it , at least in pictures .
He was so puzzled by not being attended to as usual , that he quite forgot to take off his cap .
He sat down at the table , however , and shouted '' Kellner ! '' at which all the waiters jumped , and looked round in every direction , but nobody came to him .
At first he thought they were too busy , but presently another explanation occurred to him .
`` The king , '' he said to himself , `` has threatened to execute anybody who speaks to me , or helps me in any way .
Well , I do n't mean to starve in the midst of plenty , anyhow ; here goes ! ''
The prince rose , and went to the table in the midst of the room , where a huge roast turkey had just been placed .
He helped himself to half the breast , some sausages , chestnut stuffing , bread sauce , potatoes , and a bottle of red wine -- Burgundy .
He then went back to a table in a corner , where he dined very well , nobody taking any notice of him .
When he had finished , he sat watching the other people dining , and smoking his cigarette .
As he was sitting thus , a very tall man , an officer in the uniform of the Guards , came in , and , walking straight to the prince 's table , said : `` Kellner , clean this table , and bring in the bill of fare . ''
With these words , the officer sat down suddenly in the prince 's lap , as if he did not see him at all .
He was a heavy man , and the prince , enraged at the insult , pushed him away and jumped to his feet .
As he did so , his cap dropped off .
The officer fell on his knees at once , crying : `` Pardon , my prince , pardon !
I never saw you ! ''
This was more than the prince could be expected to believe .
`` Nonsense !
Count Frederick von Matterhorn , '' he said ; `` you must be intoxicated .
Sir ! you have insulted your prince and your superior officer .
Consider yourself under arrest !
You shall be sent to a prison to-morrow . ''
On this , the poor officer appealed piteously to everybody in the tavern .
They all declared that they had not seen the prince , nor even had an idea that he was doing them the honour of being in the neighbourhood of their town .
More and more offended , and convinced that there was a conspiracy to annoy and insult him , the prince shouted for the landlord , called for his bill , threw down his three pieces of gold without asking for change , and went into the street .
`` It is a disgraceful conspiracy , '' he said .
`` The king shall answer for this !
I shall write to the newspapers at once ! ''
He was not put in a better temper by the way in which people hustled him in the street .
They ran against him exactly as if they did not see him , and then staggered back in the greatest surprise , looking in every direction for the person they had jostled .
In one of these encounters , the prince pushed so hard against a poor old beggar woman that she fell down .
As he was usually most kind and polite , he pulled off his cap to beg her pardon , when , behold , the beggar woman gave one dreadful scream , and fainted !
A crowd was collecting , and the prince , forgetting that he had thrown down all his money in the tavern , pulled out his purse .
Then he remembered what he had done , and expected to find it empty ; but , lo , there were three pieces of gold in it !
Overcome with surprise , he thrust the money into the woman 's hand , and put on his cap again .
In a moment the crowd , which had been staring at him , rushed away in every direction , with cries of terror , declaring that there was a magician in the town , and a fellow who could appear and disappear at pleasure !
By this time , you or I , or anyone who was not so extremely clever as Prince Prigio , would have understood what was the matter .
He had put on , without knowing it , not only the seven-league boots , but the cap of darkness , and had taken Fortunatus 's purse , which could never be empty , however often you took all the money out .
All those and many other delightful wares the fairies had given him at his christening , and the prince had found them in the dark garret .
But the prince was so extremely wise , and learned , and scientific , that he did not believe in fairies , nor in fairy gifts .
`` It is indigestion , '' he said to himself : `` those sausages were not of the best ; and that Burgundy was extremely strong .
Things are not as they appear . ''
Here , as he was arguing with himself , he was nearly run over by a splendid carriage and six , the driver of which never took the slightest notice of him .
Annoyed at this , the prince leaped up behind , threw down the two footmen , who made no resistance , and so was carried to the door of a magnificent palace .
He was determined to challenge the gentleman who was in the carriage ; but , noticing that he had a very beautiful young lady with him , whom he had never seen before , he followed them into the house , not wishing to alarm the girl , and meaning to speak to the gentleman when he found him alone .
A great ball was going on ; but , as usual , nobody took any notice of the prince .
He walked among the guests , being careful not to jostle them , and listening to their conversation .
It was all about himself !
Everyone had heard of his disgrace , and almost everyone cried `` Serve him right ! ''
They said that the airs he gave himself were quite unendurable -- that nothing was more rude than to be always in the right -- that cleverness might be carried far too far -- that it was better even to be born stupid `` Like the rest of you , '' thought the prince ; and , in fact , nobody had a good word for him .
Yes , one had !
It was the pretty lady of the carriage .
I never could tell you how pretty she was .
She was tall , with cheeks like white roses blushing : she had dark hair , and very large dark-grey eyes , and her face was the kindest in the world !
The prince first thought how nice and good she looked , even before he thought how pretty she looked .
She stood up for Prince Prigio when her partner would speak ill of him .
She had never seen the prince , for she was but newly come to Pantouflia ; but she declared that it was his misfortune , not his fault , to be so clever .
`` And , then , think how hard they made him work at school !
Besides , '' said this kind young lady , `` I hear he is extremely handsome , and very brave ; and he has a good heart , for he was kind , I have heard , to a poor boy , and did all his examination papers for him , so that the boy passed first in everything .
And now he is Minister for Education , though he ca n't do a line of Greek prose ! ''
The prince blushed at this , for he knew his conduct had not been honourable .
But he at once fell over head and ears in love with the young lady , a thing he had never done in his life before , because -- he said -- `` women were so stupid ! ''
You see he was so clever !
Now , at this very moment -- when the prince , all of a sudden , was as deep in love as if he had been the stupidest officer in the room -- an extraordinary thing happened !
Something seemed to give a whirr ! in his brain , and in one instant he knew all about it !
He believed in fairies and fairy gifts , and understood that his cap was the cap of darkness , and his shoes the seven-league boots , and his purse the purse of Fortunatus !
He had read about those things in historical books : but now he believed in them .
He understood all this , and burst out laughing , which nearly frightened an old lady near him out of her wits .
Ah ! how he wished he was only in evening dress , that he might dance with the charming young lady .
But there he was , dressed just as if he were going out to hunt , if anyone could have seen him .
So , even if he took off his cap of darkness , and became visible , he was no figure for a ball .
Once he would not have cared , but now he cared very much indeed .
But the prince was not clever for nothing .
He thought for a moment , then went out of the room , and , in three steps of the seven-league boots , was at his empty , dark , cold palace a","`` I 'm sure I do n't know what to do with that boy ! '' said King Prigio of Pantouflia .
`` If you do n't know , my dear , '' said Queen Rosalind , his illustrious consort , `` I ca n't see what is to be done .
You are so clever . ''
The king and queen were sitting in the royal library , of which the shelves were full of the most delightful fairy books in all languages , all equally familiar to King Prigio .
The queen could not read most of them herself , but the king used to read them aloud to her .
A good many years had passed -- seventeen , in fact -- since Queen Rosalind was married , but you would not think it to look at her .
Her grey eyes were as kind and soft and beautiful , her dark hair as dark , and her pretty colour as like a white rose blushing , as on the day when she was a bride .
And she was as fond of the king as when he was only Prince Prigio , and he was as fond of her as on the night when he first met her at the ball .
`` No , I do n't know what to do with Dick , '' said the king .
He meant his son , Prince Ricardo , but he called him Dick in private .
`` I believe it 's the fault of his education , '' his Majesty went on .
`` We have not brought him up rightly .
These fairy books are at the bottom of his provoking behaviour , '' and he glanced round the shelves .
`` Now , when I was a boy , my dear mother tried to prevent me from reading fairy books , because she did not believe in fairies . ''
`` But she was wrong , you know , '' said the queen .
`` Why , if it had not been for all these fairy presents , the Cap of Darkness and all the rest of them , you never could have killed the Fire-beast and the Ice-beast , and -- you never could have married me , '' the queen added , in a happy whisper , blushing beautifully , for that was a foolish habit of hers .
`` It is quite true , '' said the king , `` and therefore I thought it best to bring Dick up on fairy books , that he might know what is right , and have no nonsense about him .
But perhaps the thing has been overdone ; at all events , it is not a success .
I wonder if fathers and sons will ever understand each other , and get on well together ?
There was my poor father , King Grognio , he wanted me to take to adventures , like other princes , fighting Firedrakes , and so forth ; and I did not care for it , till you set me on , '' and he looked very kindly at her Majesty .
`` And now , here 's Dick , '' the monarch continued , `` I ca n't hold him back .
He is always after a giant , or a dragon , or a magician , as the case may be ; he will certainly be ploughed for his examination at College .
Never opens a book .
What does he care , off after every adventure he can hear about ?
An idle , restless youth !
Ah , my poor country , when I am gone , what may not be your misfortunes under Ricardo ! ''
Here his Majesty sighed , and seemed plunged in thought .
`` But you are not going yet , my dear , '' said the queen .
`` Why you are not forty !
And young people will be young people .
You were quite proud when poor Dick came home with his first brace of gigantic fierce birds , killed off his own sword , and with such a pretty princess he had rescued -- dear Jaqueline ?
I 'm sure she is like a daughter to me .
I can not do without her . ''
`` I wish she were a daughter-in-law ; I wish Dick would take a fancy to marry her , '' said the king .
`` A nicer girl I never saw . ''
`` And so accomplished , '' added Queen Rosalind .
`` That girl can turn herself into anything -- a mouse , a fly , a lion , a wheelbarrow , a church !
I never knew such talent for magic .
Of course she had the best of teachers , the Fairy Paribanou herself ; but very few girls , in our time , devote so many hours to practice as dear Jaqueline .
Even now , when she is out of the schoolroom , she still practises her scales .
I saw her turning little Dollie into a fish and back again in the bath-room last night .
The child was delighted . ''
In these times , you must know , princesses learned magic , just as they learn the piano nowadays ; but they had their music lessons too , dancing , calisthenics , and the use of the globes .
`` Yes , she 's a dear , good girl , '' said the king ; `` yet she looks melancholy .
I believe , myself , that if Ricardo asked her to marry him , she would not say ` No . '
But that 's just one of the things I object to most in Dick .
Round the world he goes , rescuing ladies from every kind of horror -- from dragons , giants , cannibals , magicians ; and then , when a girl naturally expects to be married to him , as is usual , off he rides !
He has no more heart than a flounder .
Why , at his age I -- '' `` At his age , my dear , you were so hard-hearted that you were quite a proverb .
Why , I have been told that you used to ask girls dreadful puzzling questions , like ` Who was Caesar Borgia ? '
` What do you know of Edwin and Morcar ? ' and so on . ''
`` I had not seen you then , '' said the king .
`` And Ricardo has not seen her , whoever she may be .
Besides , he ca n't possibly marry all of them .
And I think a girl should consider herself lucky if she is saved from a dragon or a giant , without expecting to be married next day . ''
`` Perhaps ; but it is usual , '' said the king , `` and their families expect it , and keep sending ambassadors to know what Dick 's intentions are .
I would not mind it all so very much if he killed the monsters off his own sword , as he did that first brace , in fair fight .
But ever since he found his way into that closet where the fairy presents lie , everything has been made too easy for him .
It is a royal road to glory , or giant-slaying made easy .
In his Cap of Darkness a poor brute of a dragon ca n't see him .
In his Shoes of Swiftness the giants ca n't catch him .
His Sword of Sharpness would cut any oak asunder at a blow ! ''
`` But you were very glad of them when you made the Ice-beast and the Fire - beast fight and kill each other , '' said the queen .
`` Yes , my dear ; but it wanted some wit , if I may say so , to do that , and Dick just goes at it hammer and tongs : anybody could do it .
It 's intellect I miss in Ricardo .
How am I to know whether he could make a good fight for it without all these fairy things ?
I wonder what the young rogue is about to-day ?
He 'll be late for dinner , as usual , I daresay .
I ca n't stand want of punctuality at meals , '' remarked his Majesty , which is a sign that he was growing old after all ; for where is the fun of being expected always to come home in time for dinner when , perhaps , you are fishing , and the trout are rising splendidly ?
`` Young people will be young people , '' said the queen .
`` If you are anxious about him , why do n't you look for him in the magic crystal ? ''
Now the magic crystal was a fairy present , a great ball of glass in which , if you looked , you saw the person you wanted to see , and what he was doing , however far away he might be , if he was on the earth at all .
`` I 'll just take a look at it , '' said the king ; `` it only wants three-quarters of an hour to dinner-time . ''
His Majesty rose , and walked to the crystal globe , which was in a stand , like other globes .
He stared into it , he turned it round and round , and Queen Rosalind saw him grow quite pale as he gazed .
`` I do n't see him anywhere , '' said the king , `` and I have looked everywhere .
I do hope nothing has happened to the boy .
He is so careless .
If he dropped his Cap of Darkness in a fight with a giant , why who knows what might occur ? ''
`` Oh , ` Gio , how you frighten me ! '' said the queen .
King Prigio was still turning the crystal globe .
`` Stop ! '' he cried ; `` I see a beautiful princess , fastened by iron chains to a rock beside the sea , in a lonely place .
They must have fixed her up as a sacrifice to a sea-monster , like what 's - her-name . ''
This proves how anxious he was , or , being so clever and learned , he would have remembered that her name was Andromeda .
`` I bet Dick is not far off , where there is an adventure on hand .
But where on earth can he be ?
... My word ! '' suddenly exclaimed the monarch , in obvious excitement .
`` What is it , dear ? '' cried the queen , with all the anxiety of a mother .
`` Why , the sea where the girl is , has turned all red as blood ! '' exclaimed the king .
`` Now it is all being churned up by the tail of a tremendous monster .
He is a whopper !
He 's coming on shore ; the girl is fainting .
He 's out on shore !
He is extremely poorly , blood rushing from his open jaws .
He 's dying !
And , hooray ! here 's Dick coming out of his enormous mouth , all in armour set with sharp spikes , and a sword in his hand .
He 's covered with blood , but he 's well and hearty .
He must have been swallowed by the brute , and cut him up inside .
Now he 's cutting the beast 's head off .
Now he 's gone to the princess ; a very neat bow he has made her .
Dick 's manners are positively improving !
Now he 's cutting her iron chains off with the Sword of Sharpness .
And now he 's made her another bow , and he 's actually taking leave of her .
Poor thing !
How disappointed she is looking .
And she 's so pretty , too .
I say , Rosalind , shall I shout to him through the magic horn , and tell him to bring her home here , on the magic carpet ? ''
`` I think not , dear ; the palace is quite full , '' said the queen .
But the real reason was that she wanted Ricardo to marry her favourite Princess Jaqueline , and she did not wish the new princess to come in the way .
`` As you like , '' said the king , who knew what was in her mind very well .
`` Besides , I see her own people coming for her .
I 'm sorry for her , but it ca n't be helped , and Dick is half-way home by now on the Shoes of Swiftness .
I daresay he will not keep dinner waiting after all .
But what a fright the boy has given me ! ''
At this moment a whirring in the air and a joyous shout were heard .
It was Prince Ricardo flying home on his Seven-league Boots .
`` Hi , Ross ! '' he shouted , `` just weigh this beast 's head .
I 've had a splendid day with a sea-monster .
Get the head stuffed , will you ?
We 'll have it set up in the billiard-room . ''
`` Yes , Master Dick -- I mean your Royal Highness , '' said Ross , a Highland keeper , who had not previously been employed by a Reigning Family .
`` It 's a fine head , whatever , '' he added , meditatively .
Prince Ricardo now came beneath the library window , and gave his parents a brief account of his adventure .
`` I picked the monster up early in the morning , '' he said , `` through the magic telescope , father . ''
`` What country was he in ? '' said the king .
`` The country people whom I met called it Ethiopia .
They were niggers . ''
`` And in what part of the globe is Ethiopia , Ricardo ? ''
`` Oh !
I do n't know .
Asia , perhaps , '' answered the prince .
The king groaned .
`` That boy will never understand our foreign relations .
Ethiopia in Asia ! '' he said to himself , but he did not choose to make any remark at the moment .
The prince ran upstairs to dress .
On the stairs he met the Princess Jaqueline .
`` Oh , Dick ! are you hurt ? '' she said , turning very pale .
`` No , not I ; but the monster is .
I had a capital day , Jack ; rescued a princess , too . ''
`` Was she -- was she very pretty , Dick ? ''
`` Oh !
I do n't know .
Pretty enough , I daresay .
Much like other girls .
Why , you look quite white !
What 's the matter ?
Now you look all right again ; '' for , indeed , the Princess Jaqueline was blushing .
`` I must dress .
I 'm ever so late , '' he said , hurrying upstairs ; and the princess , with a little sigh , went down to the royal drawing-room .
When dinner was over and the ladies had left the room , the king tried to speak seriously to Prince Ricardo .
This was a thing which he disliked doing very much .
`` There 's very little use in preaching , '' his Majesty used to say , `` to a man , or rather a boy , of another generation .
My taste was for books ; I only took to adventures because I was obliged to do it .
Dick 's taste is for adventures ; I only wish some accident would make him take to books .
But everyone must get his experience for himself ; and when he has got it , he is lucky if it is not too late .
I wish I could see him in love with some nice girl , who would keep him at home . ''
The king did not expect much from talking seriously to Dick .
However , he began by asking questions about the day 's sport , which Ricardo answered with modesty .
Then his Majesty observed that , from all he had ever read or heard , he believed Ethiopia , where the fight was , to be in Africa , not in Asia .
`` I really wish , Ricardo , that you would attend to your geography a little more .
It is most necessary to a soldier that he should know where his enemy is , and if he has to fight the Dutch , for instance , not to start with his army for Central Asia . ''
`` I could always spot them through the magic glass , father , '' said Dick ; `` it saves such a lot of trouble .
I hate geography . ''
`` But the glass might be lost or broken , or the Fairies might take it away , and then where are you ? ''
`` Oh , you would know where to go , or Mr. Belsham . ''
Now Mr. Belsham was his tutor , from Oxford .
`` But I shall not always be here , and when I die -- '' `` Do n't talk of dying , sire , '' said Dick .
`` Why , you are not so very old ; you may live for years yet .
Besides , I ca n't stand the notion .
You must live for ever ! ''
`` That sentiment is unusual in a Crown Prince , '' thought the king ; but he was pleased for all that .
`` Well , to oblige you , I 'll try to struggle against old age , '' he said ; `` but there are always accidents .
Now , Dick , like a good fellow , and to please me , work hard all to-morrow till the afternoon .
I 'll come in and help you .
And there 's always a splendid evening rise of trout in the lake just now , so you can have your play after your work .
You 'll enjoy it more , and I daresay you are tired after a long day with the big game .
It used to tire me , I remember . ''
`` I am rather tired , '' said Dick ; and indeed he looked a little pale , for a day in the inside of a gigantic sea-monster is fatiguing , from the heat and want of fresh air which are usually found in such places .
`` I think I 'll turn in ; goodnight , my dear old governor , '' he said , in an affectionate manner , though he was not usually given to many words .
Then he went and kissed his mother and the Princess Jaqueline , whom he engaged to row him on the lake next evening , while he fished .
`` And do n't you go muffing them with the landing-net , Jack , as you generally do , '' said his Royal Highness , as he lit his bedroom candle .
`` I wish he would not call me Jack , '' said the princess to the queen .
`` It 's better than Lina , my dear , '' said her Majesty , who in late life had become fond of her little joke ; `` that always sounds as if someone else was fatter , -- and I hope there is not someone else . ''
The princess was silent , and fixed her eyes on her book .
Presently the king came in , and played a game with Lina at picquet .
When they were all going to bed , he said : `` Just come into the study , Lina .
I want you to write a few letters for me . ''
The princess followed him and took her seat at the writing table .
The letters were very short .
One was to Herr Schnipp , tailor to the king and royal family ; another was to the royal swordmaker , another to the bootmaker , another to the optician , another to the tradesman who supplied the august family with carpets and rugs , another to his Majesty 's hatter .
They were all summoned to be at the palace early next morning .
Then his Majesty yawned , apologised , and went to bed .
The princess also went to her room , or bower as it was then called , but not to sleep .
She was unhappy that Dick did not satisfy his father , and that he was so careless , and also about other things .
`` And why does the king want all these tailors and hatters so suddenly , telescope-makers and swordmakers and shoemakers , too ? '' she asked herself , as she stood at the window watching the moon .
`` I could find out .
I could turn myself into a dog or a cat , and go into the room where he is giving his orders .
But that is awkward , for when the servants see Rip '' that was the dog `` in two places at once , they begin to think the palace is haunted , and it makes people talk .
Besides , I know it is wrong to listen to what one is not meant to hear .
It is often difficult to be a magician and a good girl .
The temptations are so strong , stronger than most people allow for . ''
So she remained , with the moon shining on her pretty yellow hair and her white dress , wondering what the king intended to do , and whether it was something that Dick would not like .
`` How stupid of me , '' she said at length , `` after all the lessons I have had .
Why , I can drink the moon ! ''
Now , this is a way of knowing what anyone else is thinking of and intends to do , for the moon sees and knows everything .
Whether it is quite fair is another matter ; but , at all events , it is not listening .
And anyone may see that , if you are a magician , like the Princess Jaqueline , a great many difficult questions as to what is right and wrong at once occur which do not trouble other people .
King Prigio 's secret , why he sent for the tailor and the other people , was his own secret .
The princess decided that she would not find it out by turning herself into Rip or the cat whose name was Semiramis , and , so far , she was quite right .
But she was very young , and it never occurred to her that it was just as wrong to find out what the king meant by drinking the moon as by listening in disguise .
As she grew older she learned to know better ; but this is just the danger of teaching young girls magic , and for that very reason it has been given up in most countries .
However , the princess did not think about right and wrong , unluckily .
She went to the bookcase and took down her Cornelius Agrippa , in one great tall black volume , with silver clasps which nobody else could open ; for , as the princess said , there are books which it would never do to leave lying about where the servants or anybody could read them .
Nobody could undo the clasps , however strong or clever he might be ; but the princess just breathed on them and made a sign , and the book flew open at the right place -- Book IV. , chapter vi. , about the middle of page 576 .
The magic spell was in Latin , of course ; but the princess knew Latin very well , and soon she had the magic song by heart .
Then she closed the book and put it back on the shelf .
Then she threw open the window and drew back the curtains , and put out all the lights except two scented candles that burned with a white fire under a round mirror with a silver frame , opposite the window .
And into that mirror the moon shone white and full , filling all the space of it , so that the room was steeped in a strange silver light .
Now the whole room seemed to sway gently , waving and trembling ; and as it trembled it sounded and rang with a low silver music , as if it were filled with the waves of the sea .
Then the princess took a great silver basin , covered with strange black signs and figures raised in the silver .
She poured water into the basin , and as she poured it she sang the magic spell from the Latin book .
It was something like this , in English : `` Oh Lady Moon , on the waters riding , On shining waters , in silver sheen , Show me the secret the heart is hiding , Show me the truth of the thought , oh Queen !
`` Oh waters white , where the moon is riding , That knows what shall be and what has been , Tell me the secret the heart is hiding , Wash me the truth of it , clear and clean ! ''
As she sang the water in the silver basin foamed and bubbled , and then fell still again ; and the princess knelt in the middle of the room , and the moon and the white light from the mirror of the moon fell in the water .
Then the princess raised the basin , and stooped her mouth to it and drank the water , spilling a few drops , and so she drank the moon and the knowledge of the moon .
Then the moon was darkened without a cloud , and there was darkness in the sky for a time , and all the dogs in the world began to howl .
When the moon shone again , the princess rose and put out the two white lights , and drew the curtains ; and presently she went to bed .
`` Now I know all about it , '' she said .
`` It is clever ; everything the king does is clever , and he is so kind that I daresay he does not mean any harm .
But it seems a cruel trick to play on poor Ricardo .
However , Jaqueline is on the watch , and I 'll show them a girl can do more than people think , '' -- as , indeed , she could .
After meditating in this way , the princess fell sleep , and did not waken till her maid came to call her .
`` Oh ! your Royal Highness , what 's this on the floor ? '' said the faithful Rosina , as she was arranging the princess 's things for her to get up .
`` Why , what is it ? '' asked the princess .
`` Ever so many -- four , five , six , seven -- little shining drops of silver lying on the carpet , as if they had melted and fallen there ! ''
`` They have not hurt the carpet ? '' said the princess .
`` Oh dear ! the queen wo n't be pleased at all .
It was a little chemical experiment I was trying last night . ''
But she knew very well that she must have dropped seven drops of the enchanted water .
`` No , your Royal Highness , the carpet is not harmed , '' said Rosina ; `` only your Royal Highness should do these things in the laboratory .
Her Majesty has often spoke about it . ''
`` You are quite right , '' said the princess ; `` but as there is no harm done , we 'll say nothing about it this time .
And , Rosina , you may keep the silver drops for yourself . ''
`` Your Royal Highness is always very kind , '' said Rosina , which was true ; but how much better and wiser it is not to begin to deceive !
We never know how far we may be carried , and so Jaqueline found out .
For when she went down to breakfast , there was the king in a great state of excitement , for him .
`` It 's most extraordinary , '' said his Majesty .
`` What is ? '' asked the queen .
`` Why , did n't you notice it ?
No , you had gone to bed before it happened .
But I was taking a walk in the moonlight , on the balcony , and I observed it carefully . ''
`` Observed what , my dear ? '' asked the queen , who was pouring out the tea .
`` Did n't you see it , Dick ?
Late as usual , you young dog ! '' the king remarked as Ricardo entered the room .
`` See what , sir ? '' said Dick .
`` Oh , you were asleep hours before , now I think of it !
But it was the most extraordinary thing , an unpredicted eclipse of the moon !
You must have noticed it , Jaqueline ; you sat up later .
How the dogs howled ! ''
`` No ; I mean yes , '' murmured poor Jaqueline , who of course had caused the whole affair by her magic arts , but who had forgotten , in the excitement of the moment , that an eclipse of the moon , especially if entirely unexpected , is likely to attract very general attention .
Jaqueline could not bear to tell a fib , especially to a king who had been so kind to her ; besides , fibbing would not alter the facts .
`` Yes , I did see it , '' she admitted , blushing .
`` Had it not been predicted ? ''
`` Not a word about it whispered anywhere , '' said his Majesty .
`` I looked up the almanack at once .
It is the most extraordinary thing I ever saw , and I 've seen a good many . ''
`` The astronomers must be duffers , '' said Prince Ricardo .
`` I never thought there was much in physical science of any sort ; most dreary stuff .
Why , they say the earth goes round the sun , whereas any fool can see it is just the other way on . ''
King Prigio was struck aghast by these sentiments in the mouth of his son and heir , the hope of Pantouflia .
But what was the king to say in reply ?
The astronomers of Pantouflia , who conceived that they knew a great deal , had certainly been taken by surprise this time .
Indeed , they have not yet satisfactorily explained this eclipse of the moon , though they have written volumes about it .
`` Why , it may be the sun next ! '' exclaimed his Majesty .
`` Anything may happen .
The very laws of gravitation themselves may go askew ! ''
At this moment the butler , William , who had been in the queen 's family when she was a girl , entered , and announced : `` Some of the royal tradesmen , by appointment , to see your Majesty . ''
So the king , who had scarcely eaten any breakfast , much to the annoyance of the queen , who was not agitated by eclipses , went out and joined the tailors and the rest of them .
Dick went on with his breakfast .
He ate cold pastry , and poached eggs , and ham , and rolls , and raspberry jam , and hot cakes ; and he drank two cups of coffee .
Meanwhile the king had joined the tradesmen who attended by his orders .
They were all met in the royal study , where the king made them a most splendid bow , and requested them to be seated .
But they declined to sit in his sacred presence , and the king observed that , in that case he must stand up .
`` I have invited you here , gentlemen , '' he said , `` on a matter of merely private importance , but I must request that you will be entirely silent as to the nature of your duties .
It is difficult , I know , not to talk about one 's work , but in this instance I am sure you will oblige me . ''
`` Your Majesty has only to command , '' said Herr Schnipp .
`` There have been monarchs , in neighbouring kingdoms , who would have cut off all our heads after we had done a bit of secret business ; but the merest word of your Majesty is law to your loving subjects . ''
The other merchants murmured assent , for King Prigio was really liked by his people .
He was always good-tempered and polite .
He never went to war with anybody .
He spent most of the royal income on public objects , and of course there were scarcely any taxes to speak of .
Moreover , he had abolished what is called compulsory education , or making everybody go to school whether he likes it or not ; a most mischievous and tyrannical measure !
`` A fellow who ca n't teach himself to read , '' said the king , `` is not worth teaching . ''
For all these reasons , and because they were so fond of the queen , his subjects were ready to do anything in reason for King Prigio .
Only one tradesman , bowing very deep and blushing very much , said : `` Your Majesty , will you hear me for one moment ? ''
`` For an hour , with pleasure , Herr Schmidt , '' said the monarch .
`` It is an untradesman-like and an unusual thing to decline an order ; and if your Majesty asked for my heart 's blood , I am ready to shed it , not to speak of anything in the line of my business -- namely , boot and shoe making .
But keep a secret from my wife , I fairly own to your Majesty that I can not . ''
Herr Schmidt went down on his knees and wept .
`` Rise , Herr Schmidt , '' said the king , taking him by the hand .
`` A more honourable and chivalrous confession of an amiable weakness , if it is to be called a weakness , I never heard .
Sir , you have been true to your honour and your prince , in face of what few men can bear , the chance of ridicule .
There is no one here , I hope , but respects and will keep the secret of Herr Schmidt 's confession ? ''
The assembled shopkeepers could scarcely refrain from tears .
`` Long live King Prigio the Good ! '' they exclaimed , and vowed that everything should be kept dark .
`` Indeed , sire , '' said the swordmaker , `` all the rest of us are bachelors . ''
`` That is none the worse for my purpose gentlemen , '' said his Majesty ; `` but I trust that you will not long deprive me of sons and subjects worthy to succeed to such fathers .
And now , if Herr Schmidt will kindly find his way to the buttery , where refreshments are ready , I shall have the pleasure of conducting you to the scene of your labours . ''
Thus speaking , the king , with another magnificent bow , led the way upstairs to a little turret-room , in a deserted part of the palace .
Bidding the tradesmen enter , he showed them a large collection of miscellaneous things : an old cap or two , a pair of boots of a sort long out of fashion , an old broadsword , a shabby old Persian rug , an ivory spy - glass , and other articles .
These were , in fact , the fairy presents , which had been given to the king at his christening , and by aid of which and his natural acuteness he had , in his youth , succeeded in many remarkable adventures .
The caps were the Wishing Cap and the Cap of Darkness .
The rug was the famous carpet which carried its owner through the air wherever he wished to go .
The sword was the Sword of Sharpness .
The ivory glass showed you anyone you wanted to see , however far off .
The boots were the Seven-league Boots , which Hop-o ' - my-Thumb stole from the Ogre about 1697 .
There were other valuable objects , but these were the most useful and celebrated .
Of course the king did not tell the tradesmen what they were .
`` Now , gentlemen , '' said his Majesty , `` you see these old things .
For reasons which I must ask you to excuse me for keeping to myself , I wish you to provide me with objects exactly and precisely similar to these , with all the look of age . ''
The tradesmen examined the objects , each choosing that in his own line of business .
`` As to the sword , sire , '' said the cutler , `` it is an Andrea Ferrara , a fine old blade .
By a lucky accident , I happen to have one at home in a small collection of ancient weapons , exactly like it .
This evening it shall be at your Majesty 's disposal . ''
`` Perhaps , Herr Schnitzler , you will kindly write an order for it , as I wish no one of you to leave the palace , if you can conveniently stay , till your business is finished . ''
`` With pleasure , your Majesty , '' says the cutler .
`` As to the old rug , '' said the upholsterer , `` I have a Persian one quite identical with it at home , at your Majesty 's service . ''
`` Then you can do like Herr Schnitzler , '' who was the cutler .
`` And I , '' said the hatter , `` have two old caps just like these , part of a bankrupt theatrical stock . ''
`` We are most fortunate , '' said the king .
`` The boots , now I come to think of it , are unimportant , at least for the present .
Perhaps we can borrow a pair from the theatre . ''
`` As for the glass , '' said the optician , `` if your Majesty will allow me to take it home with me -- '' `` I am afraid I can not part with it , '' said the king ; `` but that , too , is unimportant , or not very pressing . ''
Then he called for a servant , to order luncheon for the shopkeepers , and paper for them to write their orders on .
But no one was within hearing , and in that very old part of the palace there were no bells .
`` Just pardon me for an instant , while I run downstairs , '' said his Majesty ; `` and , it seems a strange thing to ask , but may I advise you not to sit down on that carpet ?
I have a reason for it . ''
In fact , he was afraid that someone might sit down on it , and wish he was somewhere else , and be carried away , as was the nature of the carpet .
King Prigio was not absent a minute , for he met William on the stairs ; but when he came back , there was not one single person in the turret-room !
`` Where on earth are they ? '' cried the king , rushing through all the rooms in that part of the castle .
He shouted for them , and looked everywhere ; but there was not a trace of tailor , hatter , optician , swordmaker , upholsterer .
The king hastened to a window over the gate , and saw the sentinels on duty .
`` Hi ! '' he called .
And the sentinels turned round , looked up , and saluted .
`` Have you seen anyone go out ? '' he cried .
`` No one , sire , '' answered the soldiers .
The king , who began to guess what had happened , hurried back to the turret-room .
There were all the tradesmen with parcels under their arms .
`` What means this , gentlemen ? '' said his Majesty , severely .
`` For what reason did you leave the room without my permission ? ''
They all knelt down , humbly imploring his compassion .
`` Get up , you donkeys ! '' said the king , forgetting his politeness .
`` Get up , and tell me where you have been hiding yourselves . ''
The hatter came forward , and said : `` Sire , you will not believe me ; indeed , I can scarcely believe it myself ! ''
`` Nor none of us ca n't , '' said the swordmaker .
`` We have been home , and brought the articles .
All orders e","Many years ago dinosaurs were the largest creatures on earth. Some were very large and others small. They also came in many different colors. Behind the fiery mountains was a valley in which the dinosaurs spent the day. One sunny day the dinosaurs were playing a game of soccer. A new dinosaur that the other dinosaurs had not seen before came walking by. He stopped and watched and then he asked, "" Could I play too?"" All of the other dinosaurs looked at him. Together in one giant voice they said "" NO!"" The reason they had said no to him was because he looked different than the others. He had a long neck and he was green. None of them had ever heard of or seen a long necked, green dinosaur. The new dinosaur was very sad because everyone said no to him and they even called him 'Greeny'. His feelings were hurt. Slowly he sat down and sadly watched the others play.","Many moons ago there was a folk tale passed down from generation to generation. The story is about the Cho-Cho Man or the Boogie Man. It all began with a young boy named Dakota. Dakota's mother had asked him to gather some firewood for the evening fire. The nights were getting cooler. Instead of doing the chore right away, Dakota figured he had enough sunlight left to do two things. He would gather the firewood after he played with his friends Morgan, Joey, and Bo. Not long after, his mother began to wonder why Dakota never came with any firewood. Night had fallen fast and it was too hard to see the firewood. Dakota realized what had happened. He told his friends about his predicament and they said that they would help their friend. Soon after, the young boys were gathering wood in the dark. Dakota's mother was worried that something had happened. She went looking for Dakota. Not long after, she heard the boys. She had mixed feelings. She was happy to see Dakota but she was also mad that he hadn't listened to his mother. She wanted to teach Dakota and his friends a lesson so she sneaked into the bush very quietly. Then she picked up a twig and threw it. The twig hit the ground making noise. It caught the boys' attention. She threw another broken twig in the opposite direction. The boys jumped. The mother had a hard time holding back her laughter and a muffled moan sounded through her fingers. The boys were definitely scared. But Dakota was the brave one. He ventured forward. The mother moaned again; she threw another twig. The boys were transfixed. Once more the mother moaned in a low and deep voice, ""Listen to your mother."" The boys dropped everything and ran. The mother could not hold back her laughter and the boys, hearing this, scurried home even faster. After the mother had picked up some firewood, she proceeded home, where she found Dakota in tears. Dakota exclaimed, ""Mother, Mother I'm sorry I didn't listen to you."" His mother held him with love and she knew that he was truly sorry. From then on when Dakota felt like not listening, the mother would mention, ""The boogie-man will scare you if you misbehave.""","A long time ago, in a big beautiful forest there lived many animals. The animals in the forest were happy and they lived a wonderful life. One reason that the animals were happy was because in the forest there also lived a little princess. The little princess had long curly, blonde hair. Do you know what her name was? It might surprise you but her name was Marina! Yes, Marina, a beautiful name for a beautiful little princess. Every morning she would go to the park near the river to play with her friends. Mrs. Rabbit, Mr. Skunk and the very young deer were her best friends. One day they were playing together. They were having so much fun that they lost track of the time. The sun went down and it became dark. The little animals were afraid to go home alone. Princess Marina had an idea. She said, ""Why don't you all come to my Grandpa's home with me. Grandpa doesn't mind it when I bring my friends to his place."" When Marina and her friends arrived at her grandpa's house her invited them in. He gave them all the treats that they could eat. After they ate they all played games. After a time Grandpa in a deep loud voice said, ""It's time for bed now."" Grandpa gathered all the friends around and told them a bedtime story. Before long everyone was fast asleep. In the morning it was safe for the animals to go home. Everyday Marina and her friends still play but now they make sure that they go home before it gets dark.","There was once a Miller, who, at his death, had nothing to leave to his three sons except his mill, his ass, and his cat. The eldest son took the mill, the second took the assâ and as for the youngest, all that remained for him was the cat.

The youngest son grumbled at this. ""My brothers,"" said he, ""will be able to earn an honest living; but when I have eaten my cat and sold his skin I shall die of hunger.""

The Cat, who was sitting beside him, overheard this.

""Nay, Master,"" he said, ""don't take such a gloomy view of things. If you will get me a pair of boots made so that I can walk through the brambles without hurting my feet, and give me a bag, you shall soon see what I am worth.""

The Cat's master was so surprised to hear his Cat talking, that he at once got him what he wanted. The Cat drew on the boots and slung the bag round his neck and set off for a rabbit warren. When he got there he filled his bag with bran and lettuces, and stretching himself out beside it as if dead, waited until some young rabbit should be tempted into the bag. This happened very soon. A fat, thoughtless rabbit went in headlong, and the Cat at once jumped up, pulled the strings and killed him.

Puss was very proud of his success, and, going to the King's palace, he asked to speak to the King. When he was shown into the King's presence he bowed respectfully, and, laying the rabbit down before the throne, he saidâ
""Sire, here is a rabbit, which my master, the Marquis of Carabas, desires me to present to your Majesty.""

""Tell your master,"" said the King, ""that I accept his present, and am very much obliged to him.""

A few days later, the Cat went and hid himself in a cornfield and laid his bag open as before. This time two splendid partridges were lured into the trap, and these also he took to the Palace and presented to the King from the Marquis of Carabas. The King was very pleased with this gift, and ordered the messenger of the Marquis of Carabas to be handsomely rewarded.

For two or three months the Cat went on in this way, carrying game every day to the Palace, and saying it was sent by the Marquis of Carabas.

At last the Cat happened to hear that the King was going to take a drive on the banks of the river, with his daughter, the most beautiful Princess in the world. He at once went to his master.

""Master,"" said he, ""if you follow my advice, your fortune will be made. Go and bathe in the river at a place I shall show you, and I will do the rest.""

""Very well,"" said the Miller's son, and he did as the Cat told him. When he was in the water, the Cat took away his clothes and hid them, and then ran to the road, just as the King's coach went by, calling out as loudly as he couldâ
""Help, help! The Marquis of Carabas will be drowned.""

The King looked out of the carriage window, and when he saw the Cat who had brought him so many fine rabbits and partridges, he ordered his bodyguards to fly at once to the rescue of the Marquis of Carabas.

Then the Cat came up to the carriage and told the King that while his master was bathing some robbers had stolen all his clothes. The King immediately ordered one of his own magnificent suits of clothes to be taken to the Marquis; so when the Miller's son appeared before the monarch and his daughter, he looked so handsome, and was so splendidly attired, that the Princess fell in love with him on the spot.



The King was so struck with his appearance that he insisted upon his getting into the carriage to take a drive with them.
The Cat, delighted with the way his plans were turning out, ran on before. He reached a meadow where some peasants were making hay.

""Good people,"" said he, ""if you do not tell the King, when he comes this way, that the meadow you are mowing belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall all be chopped up into little pieces.""

When the King came by, he stopped to ask the haymakers to whom the meadow belonged.
""To the Marquis of Carabas, if it please Your Majesty,"" answered they, trembling, for the Cat's threat had frightened them terribly.

The Cat, who continued to run before the carriage, now came to some reapers.
""Good people,"" said he, ""if you do not tell the King that all this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall all be chopped up into little pieces.""

The King again stopped to ask to whom the land belonged, and the reapers, obedient to the Cat's command, answeredâ
""To the Marquis of Carabas, please Your Majesty.""

And all the way the Cat kept running on before the carriage, repeating the same instructions to all the laborers he came to; so that the King became very astonished at the vast possessions of the Marquis of Carabas.

At last the Cat arrived at a great castle, where an Ogre lived who was very rich, for all the lands through which the King had been riding were part of his estate. The Cat knocked at the castle door, and asked to see the Ogre.

The Ogre received him very civilly, and asked him what he wanted.

""If you please, sir,"" said the Cat, ""I have heard that you have the power of changing yourself into any sort of animal you pleaseâand I came to see if it could possibly be true.""

""So I have,"" replied the Ogre, and in a moment he turned himself into a lion. This gave the Cat a great fright, and he scrambled up the curtains to the ceiling.

""Indeed, sir,"" he said, ""I am now quite convinced of your power to turn yourself into such a huge animal as a lion; but I do not suppose you can change yourself into a small oneâsuch as a mouse, for instance?""

""Indeed, I can,"" cried the Ogre, indignantly; and in a moment the lion had vanished, while a little brown mouse frisked about the floor.

In less than half a second the Cat sprang down from the curtains and, pouncing upon the mouse, ate him all up before the Ogre had time to return to any other shape.

And when the King arrived at the castle gates, there stood the Cat upon the doorstep, bowing and sayingâ
""Welcome to the castle of the Marquis of Carabas!""

The Marquis helped the King and the Princess to alight, and the Cat led them into a great hall, where a feast had been spread for the Ogre.

The King was so delighted with the good looks, the charming manners, and the great wealth of the Marquis of Carabas, that he said the Marquis must marry his daughter.

The Marquis, of course, replied that he should be only too happy; and the very next day he and the Princess were married.
As for the Cat, he was given the title of Puss-in-Boots, and ever after only caught mice for his own amusement.
","Great good luck once happened to a young woman who was living all alone in the woods with nobody near her but her little dog; for, to her surprise, she found fresh meat every morning at her door. She was very curious to know who it was that supplied her, and watching one morning, just as the sun had risen, she saw a handsome young man gliding away into the forest. Having seen her, he became her husband, and she had a son by him.
 
One day, not long after this, he did not return at evening, as usual, from hunting. She waited till late at night, but he came no more.
 
The next day, she swung her child to sleep in its cradle, and then said to her dog, ""Take care of your brother while I am gone, and when he cries, halloo for me.""
 
The cradle was made of the finest wampum, and all its bandages and ornaments were of the same precious stuff.
 
After a short time, the woman heard the cry of the dog, and running home as fast as she could, she found her child gone, and the dog too. On looking around, she saw scattered upon the ground pieces of the wampum of her child's cradle, and she knew that the dog had been faithful, and had striven his best to save her child from being carried off, as he had been, by an old woman, from a distant country, called Mukakee Mindemoea, or the Toad-Woman.
 
The mother hurried off at full speed in pursuit, and as she flew along, she came, from time to time, to lodges inhabited by old women, who told her at what time the child-thief had passed; they also gave her shoes that she might follow on. There was a number of these old women who seemed as if they were prophetesses, and knew what was to come long beforehand. Each of them would say to her that when she had arrived at the next lodge, she must set the toes of the moccasins they had given her pointing homeward, and that they would return of themselves. The young woman was very careful to send back in this manner all the shoes she borrowed.
 
She thus followed in the pursuit, from valley to valley, and stream to stream, for many months and years; when she came at length to the lodge of the last of the friendly old grandmothers, as they were called, who gave her the last instructions how to proceed. She told her that she was near the place where her son was to be found; and she directed her to build a lodge of cedar-boughs, hard by the old Toad-Woman's lodge, and to make a little bark dish, and to fill it with the juice of the wild grape.
 
""Then,"" she said, ""your first child (meaning the dog) will come and find you out.""
 
These directions the young woman followed just as they had been given to her, and in a short time she heard her son, now grown up, going out to hunt, with his dog, calling out to him, ""PeewaubikâSpirit-IronâTwee! Twee!""
 
The dog soon came into the lodge, and she set before him the dish of grape-juice.
 
""See, my child,"" she said, addressing him, ""the pretty drink your mother gives you.""
 
Spirit-Iron took a long draught, and immediately left the lodge with his eyes wide open; for it was the drink which teaches one to see the truth of things as they are. He rose up when he got into the open air, stood upon his hind legs, and looked about. ""I see how it is,"" he said; and marching off, erect like a man, he sought out his young master.
 
Approaching him in great confidence, he bent down and whispered in his ear (having first looked cautiously around to see that no one was listening), ""This old woman here in the lodge is no mother of yours. I have found your real mother, and she is worth looking at. When we come back from our day's sport, I'll prove it to you.""
 
They went out into the woods, and at the close of the afternoon they brought back a great spoil of meat of all kinds. The young man, as soon as he had laid aside his weapons, said to the old Toad-Woman, ""Send some of the best of this meat to the stranger who has arrived lately.""
 
The Toad-Woman answered, ""No! Why should I send to her, the poor widow!""
 
The young man would not be refused; and at last the old Toad-Woman consented to take something and throw it down at the door. She called out, ""My son gives you this."" But, being bewitched by Mukakee Mindemoea, it was so bitter and distasteful, that the young woman immediately cast it out of the lodge after her.
 
In the evening the young man paid the stranger a visit at her lodge of cedar-boughs. She then told him that she was his real mother, and that he had been stolen away from her by the old Toad-Woman, who was a child-thief and a witch. As the young man appeared to doubt, she added, ""Feign yourself sick when you go home to her lodge; and when the Toad-Woman asks what ails you, say that you wish to see your cradle; for your cradle was of wampum, and your faithful brother the dog, in striving to save you, tore off these pieces which I show you.""
 
They were real wampum, white and blue, shining and beautiful; and the young man, placing them in his bosom, set off; but as he did not seem quite steady in his belief of the strange woman's story, the dog Spirit-Iron, taking his arm, kept close by his side, and gave him many words of encouragement as they went along. They entered the lodge together; and the old Toad-Woman saw, from something in the dog's eye, that trouble was coming.
 
""Mother,"" said the young man, placing his hand to his head, and leaning heavily upon Spirit-Iron, as if a sudden faintness had come upon him, ""why am I so different in looks from the rest of your children?""
 
""Oh,"" she answered, ""it was a very bright, clear blue sky when you were born; that is the reason.""
 
He seemed to be so very ill that the Toad-Woman at length asked what she could do for him. He said nothing could do him good but the sight of his cradle. She ran immediately and brought a cedar cradle; but he said:
 
""That is not my cradle.""
 
She went and got another of her own children's cradles, of which there were four; but he turned his head, and said:
 
""That is not mine; I am as sick as ever.""
 
When she had shown the four, and they had been all rejected, she at last produced the real cradle. The young man saw that it was of the same stuff as the wampum which he had in his bosom. He could even see the marks of the teeth of Spirit-Iron left upon the edges, where he had taken hold, striving to hold it back. He had no doubt, now, which was his mother.
 
To get free of the old Toad-Woman, it was necessary that the young man should kill a fat bear; and, being directed by Spirit-Iron, who was very wise in such a matter, he secured the fattest in all that country; and having stripped a tall pine of all its bark and branches, he perched the carcass in the top, with its head to the east and its tail due west. Returning to the lodge, he informed the old Toad-Woman that the fat bear was ready for her, but that she would have to go very far, even to the end of the earth, to get it. She answered:
 
""It is not so far but that I can get it;"" for of all things in the world, a fat bear was the delight of the old Toad-Woman.
 
She at once set forth; and she was no sooner out of sight than the young man and his dog, Spirit-Iron, blowing a strong breath in the face of the Toad-Woman's four children (who were all bad spirits, or bear-fiends), they put out their life. They then set them up by the side of the door, having first thrust a piece of the white fat in each of their mouths.
 
The Toad-Woman spent a long time in finding the bear which she had been sent after, and she made at least five and twenty attempts before she was able to climb to the carcass. She slipped down three times where she went up once. When she returned with the great bear on her back, as she drew near her lodge she was astonished to see the four children standing up by the door-posts with the fat in their mouths. She was angry with them, and called out:
 
""Why do you thus insult the pomatum of your brother?""
 
She was still more angry when they made no answer to her complaint; but when she found that they were stark dead, and placed in this way to mock her, her fury was very great indeed. She ran after the tracks of the young man and his mother as fast as she could; so fast, indeed, that she was on the very point of overtaking them, when the dog, Spirit-Iron, coming close up to his master, whispered to himâ""Snakeberry!""
 
""Let the snakeberry spring up to detain her!"" cried out the young man; and immediately the berries spread like scarlet all over the path, for a long distance; and the old Toad-Woman, who was almost as fond of these berries as she was of fat bears, could not avoid stooping down to pick and eat.
 
The old Toad-Woman was very anxious to get forward, but the snakeberry-vines kept spreading out on every side; and they still grow and grow, and spread and spread; and to this day the wicked old Toad-Woman is busy picking the berries, and she will never be able to get beyond to the other side, to disturb the happiness of the young hunter and his mother, who still live, with their faithful dog, in the shadow of the beautiful wood-side where they were born.","Marjorie sat on the door-step , shelling peas , quite unconscious what a pretty picture she made , with the roses peeping at her through the lattice work of the porch , the wind playing hide-and-seek in her curly hair , while the sunshine with its silent magic changed her faded gingham to a golden gown , and shimmered on the bright tin pan as if it were a silver shield .
Old Rover lay at her feet , the white kitten purred on her shoulder , and friendly robins hopped about her in the grass , chirping `` A happy birthday , Marjorie ! ''
But the little maid neither saw nor heard , for her eyes were fixed on the green pods , and her thoughts were far away .
She was recalling the fairy-tale granny told her last night , and wishing with all her heart that such things happened nowadays .
For in this story , as a poor girl like herself sat spinning before the door , a Brownie came by , and gave the child a good-luck penny ; then a fairy passed , and left a talisman which would keep her always happy ; and last of all , the prince rolled up in his chariot , and took her away to reign with him over a lovely kingdom , as a reward for her many kindnesses to others .
When Marjorie imagined this part of the story , it was impossible to help giving one little sigh , and for a minute she forgot her work , so busy was she thinking what beautiful presents she would give to all the poor children in her realm when THEY had birthdays .
Five impatient young peas took this opportunity to escape from the half-open pod in her hand and skip down the steps , to be immediately gobbled up by an audacious robin , who gave thanks in such a shrill chirp that Marjorie woke up , laughed , and fell to work again .
She was just finishing , when a voice called out from the lane , -- `` Hi , there ! come here a minute , child ! '' and looking up , she saw a little old man in a queer little carriage drawn by a fat little pony .
Running down to the gate , Marjorie dropped a curtsy , saying pleasantly , -- `` What did you wish , sir ? ''
`` Just undo that check-rein for me . I am lame , and Jack wants to drink at your brook , '' answered the old man , nodding at her till his spectacles danced on his nose .
Marjorie was rather afraid of the fat pony , who tossed his head , whisked his tail , and stamped his feet as if he was of a peppery temper .
But she liked to be useful , and just then felt as if there were few things she could NOT do if she tried , because it was her birthday .
So she proudly let down the rein , and when Jack went splashing into the brook , she stood on the bridge , waiting to check him up again after he had drunk his fill of the clear , cool water .
The old gentleman sat in his place , looking up at the little girl , who was smiling to herself as she watched the blue dragon-flies dance among the ferns , a blackbird tilt on the alderboughs , and listened to the babble of the brook .
`` How old are you , child ? '' asked the old man , as if he rather envied this rosy creature her youth and health .
`` Twelve to-day , sir ; '' and Marjorie stood up straight and tall , as if mindful of her years .
`` Had any presents ? '' asked the old man , peering up with an odd smile .
`` One , sir , -- here it is ; '' and she pulled out of her pocket a tin savings-bank in the shape of a desirable family mansion , painted red , with a green door and black chimney .
Proudly displaying it on the rude railing of the bridge , she added , with a happy face , -- `` Granny gave it to me , and all the money in it is going to be mine . ''
`` How much have you got ? '' asked the old gentleman , who appeared to like to sit there in the middle of the brook , while Jack bathed his feet and leisurely gurgled and sneezed .
`` Not a penny yet , but I 'm going to earn some , '' answered Marjorie , patting the little bank with an air of resolution pretty to see .
`` How will you do it ? '' continued the inquisitive old man .
`` Oh , I 'm going to pick berries and dig dandelions , and weed , and drive cows , and do chores .
It is vacation , and I can work all the time , and earn ever so much . ''
`` But vacation is play-time , -- how about that ? ''
`` Why , that sort of work IS play , and I get bits of fun all along .
I always have a good swing when I go for the cows , and pick flowers with the dandelions .
Weeding is n't so nice , but berrying is very pleasant , and we have good times all together . ''
`` What shall you do with your money when you get it ? ''
`` Oh , lots of things !
Buy books and clothes for school , and , if I get a great deal , give some to granny .
I 'd love to do that , for she takes care of me , and I 'd be so proud to help her ! ''
`` Good little lass ! '' said the old gentleman , as he put his hand in his pocket .
`` Would you now ? '' he added , apparently addressing himself to a large frog who sat upon a stone , looking so wise and grandfatherly that it really did seem quite proper to consult him .
At all events , he gave his opinion in the most decided manner , for , with a loud croak , he turned an undignified somersault into the brook , splashing up the water at a great rate .
`` Well , perhaps it would n't be best on the whole .
Industry is a good teacher , and money can not buy happiness , as I know to my sorrow . ''
The old gentleman still seemed to be talking to the frog , and as he spoke he took his hand out of his pocket with less in it than he had at first intended .
`` What a very queer person ! '' thought Marjorie , for she had not heard a word , and wondered what he was thinking about down there .
Jack walked out of the brook just then , and she ran to check him up ; not an easy task for little hands , as he preferred to nibble the grass on the bank .
But she did it cleverly , smoothed the ruffled mane , and , dropping another curtsy , stood aside to let the little carriage pass .
`` Thank you , child -- thank you .
Here is something for your bank , and good luck to it . ''
As he spoke , the old man laid a bright gold dollar in her hand , patted the rosy cheek , and vanished in a cloud of dust , leaving Marjorie so astonished at the grandeur of the gift , that she stood looking at it as if it had been a fortune .
It was to her ; and visions of pink calico gowns , new grammars , and fresh hat-ribbons danced through her head in delightful confusion , as her eyes rested on the shining coin in her palm .
Then , with a solemn air , she invested her first money by popping it down the chimney of the scarlet mansion , and peeping in with one eye to see if it landed safely on the ground-floor .
This done , she took a long breath , and looked over the railing , to be sure it was not all a dream .
No ; the wheel marks were still there , the brown water was not yet clear , and , if a witness was needed , there sat the big frog again , looking so like the old gentleman , with his bottle-green coat , speckled trousers , and twinkling eyes , that Marjorie burst out laughing , and clapped her hands , saying aloud , -- `` I 'll play he was the Brownie , and this is the good-luck penny he gave me .
Oh , what fun ! '' and away she skipped , rattling the dear new bank like a castanet .
When she had told granny all about it , she got knife and basket , and went out to dig dandelions ; for the desire to increase her fortune was so strong , she could not rest a minute .
Up and down she went , so busily peering and digging , that she never lifted up her eyes till something like a great white bird skimmed by so low she could not help seeing it .
A pleasant laugh sounded behind her as she started up , and , looking round , she nearly sat down again in sheer surprise , for there close by was a slender little lady , comfortably established under a big umbrella .
`` If there WERE any fairies , I 'd be sure that was one , '' thought Marjorie , staring with all her might , for her mind was still full of the old story ; and curious things do happen on birthdays , as every one knows .
It really did seem rather elfish to look up suddenly and see a lovely lady all in white , with shining hair and a wand in her hand , sitting under what looked very like a large yellow mushroom in the middle of a meadow , where , till now , nothing but cows and grasshoppers had been seen .
Before Marjorie could decide the question , the pleasant laugh came again , and the stranger said , pointing to the white thing that was still fluttering over the grass like a little cloud , -- `` Would you kindly catch my hat for me , before it blows quite away ? ''
Down went basket and knife , and away ran Marjorie , entirely satisfied now that there was no magic about the new-comer ; for if she had been an elf , could n't she have got her hat without any help from a mortal child ?
Presently , however , it did begin to seem as if that hat was bewitched , for it led the nimble-footed Marjorie such a chase that the cows stopped feeding to look on in placid wonder ; the grasshoppers vainly tried to keep up , and every ox-eye daisy did its best to catch the runaway , but failed entirely , for the wind liked a game of romps , and had it that day .
As she ran , Marjorie heard the lady singing , like the princess in the story of the Goose-Girl , -- `` Blow , breezes , blow !
Let Curdkin 's hat go !
Blow , breezes , blow !
Let him after it go !
O'er hills , dales and rocks , Away be it whirled , Till the silvery locks Are all combed and curled . ''
This made her laugh so that she tumbled into a clover-bed , and lay there a minute to get her breath .
Just then , as if the playful wind repented of its frolic , the long veil fastened to the hat caught in a blackberry-vine near by , and held the truant fast till Marjorie secured it .
`` Now come and see what I am doing , '' said the lady , when she had thanked the child .
Marjorie drew near confidingly , and looked down at the wide-spread book before her .
She gave a start , and laughed out with surprise and delight ; for there was a lovely picture of her own little home , and her own little self on the door-step , all so delicate , and beautiful , and true , it seemed as if done by magic .
`` Oh , how pretty !
There is Rover , and Kitty and the robins , and me !
How could you ever do it , ma'am ? '' said Marjorie , with a wondering glance at the long paint-brush , which had wrought what seemed a miracle to her childish eyes .
`` I 'll show you presently ; but tell me , first , if it looks quite right and natural to you .
Children sometimes spy out faults that no one else can see , '' answered the lady , evidently pleased with the artless praise her work received .
`` It looks just like our house , only more beautiful .
Perhaps that is because I know how shabby it really is .
That moss looks lovely on the shingles , but the roof leaks .
The porch is broken , only the roses hide the place ; and my gown is all faded , though it once was as bright as you have made it .
I wish the house and everything would stay pretty forever , as they will in the picture . ''
While Marjorie spoke , the lady had been adding more color to the sketch , and when she looked up , something warmer and brighter than sunshine shone in her face , as she said , so cheerily , it was like a bird 's song to hear her , -- `` It ca n't be summer always , dear , but we can make fair weather for ourselves if we try .
The moss , the roses , and soft shadows show the little house and the little girl at their best , and that is what we all should do ; for it is amazing how lovely common things become , if one only knows how to look at them . ''
`` I wish I did , '' said Marjorie , half to herself , remembering how often she was discontented , and how hard it was to get on , sometimes .
`` So do I , '' said the lady , in her happy voice .
`` Just believe that there is a sunny side to everything , and try to find it , and you will be surprised to see how bright the world will seem , and how cheerful you will be able to keep your little self . ''
`` I guess granny has found that out , for she never frets .
I do , but I 'm going to stop it , because I 'm twelve to-day , and that is too old for such things , '' said Marjorie , recollecting the good resolutions she had made that morning when she woke .
`` I am twice twelve , and not entirely cured yet ; but I try , and do n't mean to wear blue spectacles if I can help it , '' answered the lady , laughing so blithely that Marjorie was sure she would not have to try much longer .
`` Birthdays were made for presents , and I should like to give you one .
Would it please you to have this little picture ? '' she added , lifting it out of the book .
`` Truly my own ?
Oh , yes , indeed ! '' cried Marjorie , coloring with pleasure , for she had never owned so beautiful a thing before .
`` Then you shall have it , dear .
Hang it where you can see it often , and when you look , remember that it is the sunny side of home , and help to keep it so . ''
Marjorie had nothing but a kiss to offer by way of thanks , as the lovely sketch was put into her hand ; but the giver seemed quite satisfied , for it was a very grateful little kiss .
Then the child took up her basket and went away , not dancing and singing now , but slowly and silently ; for this gift made her thoughtful as well as glad .
As she climbed the wall , she looked back to nod good-by to the pretty lady ; but the meadow was empty , and all she saw was the grass blowing in the wind .
`` Now , deary , run out and play , for birthdays come but once a year , and we must make them as merry as we can , '' said granny , as she settled herself for her afternoon nap , when the Saturday cleaning was all done , and the little house as neat as wax .
So Marjorie put on a white apron in honor of the occasion , and , taking Kitty in her arms , went out to enjoy herself .
Three swings on the gate seemed to be a good way of beginning the festivities ; but she only got two , for when the gate creaked back the second time , it stayed shut , and Marjorie hung over the pickets , arrested by the sound of music .
`` It 's soldiers , '' she said , as the fife and drum drew nearer , and flags were seen waving over the barberry-bushes at the corner .
`` No ; it 's a picnic , '' she added in a moment ; for she saw hats with wreaths about them bobbing up and down , as a gayly-trimmed hay-cart full of children came rumbling down the lane .
`` What a nice time they are going to have ! '' thought Marjorie , sadly contrasting that merry-making with the quiet party she was having all by herself .
Suddenly her face shone , and Kitty was waved over her head like a banner , as she flew out of the gate , crying , rapturously , -- `` It 's Billy ! and I know he 's come for me ! ''
It certainly WAS Billy , proudly driving the old horse , and beaming at his little friend from the bower of flags and chestnut-boughs , where he sat in state , with a crown of daisies on his sailor-hat and a spray of blooming sweetbrier in his hand .
Waving his rustic sceptre , he led off the shout of `` Happy birthday , Marjorie ! '' which was set up as the wagon stopped at the gate , and the green boughs suddenly blossomed with familiar faces , all smiling on the little damsel , who stood in the lane quite overpowered with delight .
`` It 's a s ` prise party ! '' cried one small lad , tumbling out behind .
`` We are going up the mountain to have fun ! '' added a chorus of voices , as a dozen hands beckoned wildly .
`` We got it up on purpose for you , so tie your hat and come away , '' said a pretty girl , leaning down to kiss Marjorie , who had dropped Kitty , and stood ready for any splendid enterprise .
A word to granny , and away went the happy child , sitting up beside Billy , under the flags that waved over a happier load than any royal chariot ever bore .
It would be vain to try and tell all the plays and pleasures of happy children on a Saturday afternoon , but we may briefly say that Marjorie found a mossy stone all ready for her throne , and Billy crowned her with a garland like his own .
That a fine banquet was spread , and eaten with a relish many a Lord Mayor 's feast has lacked .
Then how the whole court danced and played together afterward !
The lords climbed trees and turned somersaults , the ladies gathered flowers and told secrets under the sweetfern-bushes , the queen lost her shoe jumping over the waterfall , and the king paddled into the pool below and rescued it .
A happy little kingdom , full of summer sunshine , innocent delights , and loyal hearts ; for love ruled , and the only war that disturbed the peaceful land was waged by the mosquitoes as night came on .
Marjorie stood on her throne watching the sunset while her maids of honor packed up the remains of the banquet , and her knights prepared the chariot .
All the sky was gold and purple , all the world bathed in a soft , red light , and the little girl was very happy as she looked down at the subjects who had served her so faithfully that day .
`` Have you had a good time , Marjy ? '' asked King William ; who stood below , with his royal nose on a level with her majesty 's two dusty little shoes .
`` Oh , Billy , it has been just splendid !
But I do n't see why you should all be so kind to me , '' answered Marjorie , with such a look of innocent wonder , that Billy laughed to see it .
`` Because you are so sweet and good , we ca n't help loving you , -- that 's why , '' he said , as if this simple fact was reason enough .
`` I 'm going to be the best girl that ever was , and love everybody in the world , '' cried the child , stretching out her arms as if ready , in the fulness of her happy heart , to embrace all creation .
`` Do n't turn into an angel and fly away just yet , but come home , or granny will never lend you to us any more . ''
With that , Billy jumped her down , and away they ran , to ride gayly back through the twilight , singing like a flock of nightingales .
As she went to bed that night , Marjorie looked at the red bank , the pretty picture , and the daisy crown , saying to herself , -- `` It has been a VERY nice birthday , and I am something like the girl in the story , after all , for the old man gave me a good-luck penny , the kind lady told me how to keep happy , and Billy came for me like the prince .
The girl did n't go back to the poor house again , but I 'm glad I did , for MY granny is n't a cross one , and my little home is the dearest in the world . ''
Then she tied her night-cap , said her prayers , and fell asleep ; but the moon , looking in to kiss the blooming face upon the pillow , knew that three good spirits had come to help little Marjorie from that day forth , and their names were Industry , Cheerfulness , and Love .
It was a cold November storm , and everything looked forlorn .
Even the pert sparrows were draggle-tailed and too much out of spirits to fight for crumbs with the fat pigeons who tripped through the mud with their little red boots as if in haste to get back to their cosy home in the dove-cot .
But the most forlorn creature out that day was a small errand girl , with a bonnet-box on each arm , and both hands struggling to hold a big broken umbrella .
A pair of worn-out boots let in the wet upon her tired feet ; a thin cotton dress and an old shawl poorly protected her from the storm ; and a faded hood covered her head .
The face that looked out from this hood was too pale and anxious for one so young ; and when a sudden gust turned the old umbrella inside out with a crash , despair fell upon poor Lizzie , and she was so miserable she could have sat down in the rain and cried .
But there was no time for tears ; so , dragging the dilapidated umbrella along , she spread her shawl over the bonnet-boxes and hurried down the broad street , eager to hide her misfortunes from a pretty young girl who stood at a window laughing at her .
She could not find the number of the house where one of the fine hats was to be left ; and after hunting all down one side of the street , she crossed over , and came at last to the very house where the pretty girl lived .
She was no longer to be seen ; and , with a sigh of relief , Lizzie rang the bell , and was told to wait in the hall while Miss Belle tried the hat on .
Glad to rest , she warmed her feet , righted her umbrella , and then sat looking about her with eyes quick to see the beauty and the comfort that made the place so homelike and delightful .
A small waiting-room opened from the hall , and in it stood many blooming plants , whose fragrance attracted Lizzie as irresistibly as if she had been a butterfly or bee .
Slipping in , she stood enjoying the lovely colors , sweet odors , and delicate shapes of these household spirits ; for Lizzie loved flowers passionately ; and just then they possessed a peculiar charm for her .
One particularly captivating little rose won her heart , and made her long for it with a longing that became a temptation too strong to resist .
It was so perfect ; so like a rosy face smiling out from the green leaves , that Lizzie could NOT keep her hands off it , and having smelt , touched , and kissed it , she suddenly broke the stem and hid it in her pocket .
Then , frightened at what she had done , she crept back to her place in the hall , and sat there , burdened with remorse .
A servant came just then to lead her upstairs ; for Miss Belle wished the hat altered , and must give directions .
With her heart in a flutter , and pinker roses in her cheeks than the one in her pocket , Lizzie followed to a handsome room , where a pretty girl stood before a long mirror with the hat in her hand .
`` Tell Madame Tifany that I do n't like it at all , for she has n't put in the blue plume mamma ordered ; and I wo n't have rose-buds , they are so common , '' said the young lady , in a dissatisfied tone , as she twirled the hat about .
`` Yes , miss , '' was all Lizzie could say ; for SHE considered that hat the loveliest thing a girl could possibly own .
`` You had better ask your mamma about it , Miss Belle , before you give any orders .
She will be up in a few moments , and the girl can wait , '' put in a maid , who was sewing in the ante-room .
`` I suppose I must ; but I WO N'T have roses , '' answered Belle , crossly .
Then she glanced at Lizzie , and said more gently , `` You look very cold ; come and sit by the fire while you wait . ''
`` I 'm afraid I 'll wet the pretty rug , miss ; my feet are sopping , '' said Lizzie , gratefully , but timidly .
`` So they are !
Why did n't you wear rubber boots ? ''
`` I have n't got any . ''
`` I 'll give you mine , then , for I hate them ; and as I never go out in wet weather , they are of no earthly use to me .
Marie , bring them here ; I shall be glad to get rid of them , and I 'm sure they 'll be useful to you . ''
`` Oh , thank you , miss !
I 'd like 'em ever so much , for I 'm out in the rain half the time , and get bad colds because my boots are old , '' said Lizzie , smiling brightly at the thought of the welcome gift .
`` I should think your mother would get you warmer things , '' began Belle , who found something rather interesting in the shabby girl , with shy bright eyes , and curly hair bursting out of the old hood .
`` I have n't got any mother , '' said Lizzie , with a pathetic glance at her poor clothes .
`` I 'm so sorry !
Have you brothers and sisters ? '' asked Belle , hoping to find something pleasant to talk about ; for she was a kind little soul .
`` No , miss ; I 've got no folks at all . ''
`` Oh , dear ; how sad !
Why , who takes care of you ? '' cried Belle , looking quite distressed .
`` No one ; I take care of myself .
I work for Madame , and she pays me a dollar a week .
I stay with Mrs. Brown , and chore round to pay for my keep .
My dollar do n't get many clothes , so I ca n't be as neat as I 'd like . ''
And the forlorn look came back to poor Lizzie 's face .
Belle said nothing , but sat among the sofa cushions , where she had thrown herself , looking soberly at this other girl , no older than she was , who took care of herself and was all alone in the world .
It was a new idea to Belle , who was loved and petted as an only child is apt to be .
She often saw beggars and pitied them , but knew very little about their wants and lives ; so it was like turning a new page in her happy life to be brought so near to poverty as this chance meeting with the milliner 's girl .
`` Are n't you afraid and lonely and unhappy ? '' she said , slowly , trying to understand and put herself in Lizzie 's place .
`` Yes ; but it 's no use .
I ca n't help it , and may be things will get better by and by , and I 'll have my wish , '' answered Lizzie , more hopefully , because Belle 's pity warmed her heart and made her troubles seem lighter .
`` What is your wish ? '' asked Belle , hoping mamma would n't come just yet , for she was getting interested in the stranger .
`` To have a nice little room , and make flowers , like a French girl I know .
It 's such pretty work , and she gets lots of money , for every one likes her flowers .
She shows me how , sometimes , and I can do leaves first-rate ; but -- '' There Lizzie stopped suddenly , and the color rushed up to her forehead ; for she remembered the little rose in her pocket and it weighed upon her conscience like a stone .
Before Belle could ask what was the matter , Marie came in with a tray of cake and fruit , saying : `` Here 's your lunch , Miss Belle . ''
`` Put it down , please ; I 'm not ready for it yet . ''
And Belle shook her head as she glanced at Lizzie , who was staring hard at the fire with such a troubled face that Belle could not bear to see it .
Jumping out of her nest of cushions , she heaped a plate with good things , and going to Lizzie , offered it , saying , with a gentle courtesy that made the act doubly sweet : `` Please have some ; you must be tired of waiting . ''
But Lizzie could not take it ; she could only cover her face and cry ; for this kindness rent her heart and made the stolen flower a burden too heavy to be borne .
`` Oh , do n't cry so !
Are you sick ?
Have I been rude ?
Tell me all about it ; and if I ca n't do anything , mamma can , '' said Belle , surprised and troubled .
`` No ; I 'm not sick ; I 'm bad , and I ca n't bear it when you are so good to me , '' sobbed Lizzie , quite overcome with penitence ; and taking out the crumpled rose , she confessed her fault with many tears .
`` Do n't feel so much about such a little thing as that , '' began Belle , warmly ; then checked herself , and added , more soberly , `` It WAS wrong to take it without leave ; but it 's all right now , and I 'll give you as many roses as you want , for I know you are a good girl . ''
`` Thank you .
I did n't want it only because it was pretty , but I wanted to copy it .
I ca n't get any for myself , and so I ca n't do my make-believe ones well .
Madame wo n't even lend me the old ones in the store , and Estelle has none to spare for me , because I ca n't pay her for teaching me .
She gives me bits of muslin and wire and things , and shows me now and then .
But I know if I had a real flower I could copy it ; so she 'd see I did know something , for I try real hard .
I 'm SO tired of slopping round the streets , I 'd do anything to earn my living some other way . ''
Lizzie had poured out her trouble rapidly ; and the little story was quite affecting when one saw the tears on her cheeks , the poor clothes , and the thin hands that held the stolen rose .
Belle was much touched , and , in her impetuous way , set about mending matters as fast as possible .
`` Put on those boots and that pair of dry stockings right away .
Then tuck as much cake and fruit into your pocket as it will hold .
I 'm going to get you some flowers , and see if mamma is too busy to attend to me . ''
With a nod and a smile , Belle flew about the room a minute ; then vanished , leaving Lizzie to her comfortable task , feeling as if fairies still haunted the world as in the good old times .
When Belle came back with a handful of roses , she found Lizzie absorbed in admiring contemplation of her new boots , as she ate sponge-cake in a blissful sort of waking-dream .
`` Mamma ca n't come ; but I do n't care about the hat .
It will do very well , and is n't worth fussing about .
There , will those be of any use to you ? ''
And she offered the nosegay with a much happier face than the one Lizzie first saw .
`` Oh , miss , they 're just lovely !
I 'll copy that pink rose as soon as ever I can , and when I 've learned how to do 'em tip-top , I 'd like to bring you some , if you do n't mind , '' answered Lizzie , smiling all over her face as she buried her nose luxuriously in the fragrant mass .
`` I 'd like it very much , for I should think you 'd have to be very clever to make such pretty things .
I really quite fancy those rosebuds in my hat , now I know that you 're going to learn how to make them .
Put an orange in your pocket , and the flowers in water as soon as you can , so they 'll be fresh when you want them .
Good-by .
Bring home our hats every time and tell me how you get on . ''
With kind words like these , Belle dismissed Lizzie , who ran downstairs , feeling as rich as if she had found a fortune .
Away to the next place she hurried , anxious to get her errands done and the precious posy safely into fresh water .
But Mrs. Turretviile was not at home , and the bonnet could not be left till paid for .
So Lizzie turned to go down the high steps , glad that she need not wait .
She stopped one instant to take a delicious sniff at her flowers , and that was the last happy moment that poor Lizzie knew for many weary months .
The new boots were large for her , the steps slippery with sleet , and down went the little errand girl , from top to bottom , till she landed in the gutter directly upon Mrs. Turretville 's costly bonnet .
`` I 've saved my posies , anyway , '' sighed Lizzie , as she picked herself up , bruised , wet , and faint with pain ; `` but , oh , my heart ! wo n't Madame scold when she sees that band-box smashed flat , '' groaned the poor child , sitting on the curbstone to get her breath and view the disaster .
The rain poured , the wind blew , the sparrows on the park railing chirped derisively , and no one came along to help Lizzie out of her troubles .
Slowly she gathered up her burdens ; painfully she limped away in the big boots ; and the last the naughty sparrows saw of her was a shabby little figure going round the corner , with a pale , tearful face held lovingly over the bright bouquet that was her one treasure and her only comfort in the moment which brought to her the great misfortune of her life .
II .
FORGET-ME-NOTS `` Oh , mamma , I am so relieved that the box has come at last !
If it had not , I do believe I should have died of disappointment , '' cried pretty Belle , five years later , on the morning before her eighteenth birthday .
`` It would have been a serious disappointment , darling ; for I had sot my heart on your wearing my gift to-morrow night , and when the steamers kept coming in without my trunk from Paris , I was very anxious .
I hope you will like it . ''
`` Dear mamma , I know I shall like it ; your taste is so good and you know what suits me so well .
Make haste , Marie ; I 'm dying to see it , '' said Belle , dancing about the great trunk , as the maid carefully unfolded tissue papers and muslin wrappers .
A young girl 's first ball-dress is a grand affair , -- in her eyes , at least ; and Belle soon stopped dancing , to stand with clasped hands , eager eyes and parted lips before the snowy pile of illusion that was at last daintily lifted out upon the bed .
Then , as Marie displayed its loveliness , little cries of delight were heard , and when the whole delicate dress was arranged to the best effect she threw herself upon her mother 's neck and actually cried with pleasure .
`` Mamma , it is too lovely I and you are very kind to do so much for me .
How shall I ever thank you ? ''
`` By putting it right on to see if it fits ; and when you wear it look your happiest , that I may be proud of my pretty daughter . ''
Mamma got no further , for Marie uttered a French shriek , wrung her hands , and then began to burrow wildly in the trunk and among the papers , crying distractedly : `` Great Heavens , madame ! the wreath has been forgotten !
What an affliction !
Mademoiselle 's enchanting toilette is destroyed without the wreath , and nowhere do I find it . ''
In vain they searched ; in vain Marie wailed and Belle declared it must be somewhere ; no wreath appeared .
It was duly set down in the bill , and a fine sum charged for a head-dress to match the dainty forget-me-nots t","DING-DONG !
Ding-dong !
Ding-dong !
The town crier has rung his bell , at a distant corner , and little Annie stands on her father 's doorsteps , trying to hear what the man with the loud voice is talking about .
Let me listen too .
O , he is telling the people that an elephant , and a lion , and a royal tiger , and a horse with horns , and other strange beasts from foreign countries , have come to town , and will receive all visitors who choose to wait upon them !
Perhaps little Annie would like to go .
Yes ; and I can see that the pretty child is weary of this wide and pleasant street , with the green trees flinging their shade across the quiet sunshine , and the pavements and the sidewalks all as clean as if the housemaid had just swept them with her broom .
She feels that impulse to go strolling away -- that longing after the mystery of the great world -- which many children feel , and which I felt in my childhood .
Little Annie shall take a ramble with me .
See !
I do but hold out my hand , and , like some bright bird in the sunny air , with her blue silk frock fluttering upwards from her white pantalets , she comes bounding on tiptoe across the street .
Smooth back your brown curls , Annie ; and let me tie on your bonnet , and we will set forth !
What a strange couple to go on their rambles together !
One walks in black attire , with a measured step , and a heavy brow , and his thoughtful eyes bent down , while the gay little girl trips lightly along , as if she were forced to keep hold of my hand , lest her feet should dance away from the earth .
Yet there is sympathy between us .
If I pride myself on anything , it is because I have a smile that children love ; and , on the other hand , there are few grown ladies that could entice me from the side of little Annie ; for I delight to let my mind go hand in hand with the mind of a sinless child .
So , come , Annie ; but if I moralize as we go , do not listen to me ; only look about you , and be merry !
Now we turn the corner .
Here are hacks with two horses , and stage-coaches with four , thundering to meet each other , and trucks and carts moving at a slower pace , being heavily laden with barrels from the wharves , and here are rattling gigs , which perhaps will be smashed to pieces before our eyes .
Hitherward , also , comes a man trundling a wheelbarrow along the pavement .
Is not little Annie afraid of such a tumult ?
No ; she does not even shrink closer to my side , but passes on with fearless confidence , a happy child amidst a great throng of grown people , who pay the same reverence to her infancy that they would to extreme old age .
Nobody jostles her ; all turn aside to make way for little Annie ; and , what is most singular , she appears conscious of her claim to such respect .
Now her eyes brighten with pleasure !
A street-musician has seated himself on the steps of yonder church , and pours forth his strains to the busy town , a melody that has gone astray among the tramp of footsteps , the buzz of voices , and the war of passing wheels .
Who heeds the poor organ-grinder ?
None but myself and little Annie , whose feet begin to move in unison with the lively tune , as if she were loath that music should be wasted without a dance .
But where would Annie find a partner ?
Some have the gout in their toes , or the rheumatism in their joints ; some are stiff with age ; some feeble with disease ; some are so lean that their bones would rattle , and others of such ponderous size that their agility would crack the flagstones ; but many , many have leaden feet , because their hearts are far heavier than lead .
It is a sad thought that I have chanced upon .
What a company of dancers should we be !
For I , too , am a gentleman of sober footsteps , and therefore , little Annie , let us walk sedately on .
It is a question with me , whether this giddy child , or my sage self , have most pleasure in looking at the shop-windows .
We love the silks of sunny hue , that glow within the darkened premises of the spruce drygoods ' men ; we are pleasantly dazzled by the burnished silver , and the chased gold , the rings of wedlock and the costly love-ornaments , glistening at the window of the jeweller ; but Annie , more than I , seeks for a glimpse of her passing figure in the dusty looking-glasses at the hardware stores .
All that is bright and gay attracts us both .
Here is a shop to which the recollections of my boyhood , as well as present partialities , give a peculiar magic .
How delightful to let the fancy revel on the dainties of a confectioner ; those pies , with such white and flaky paste , their contents being a mystery , whether rich mince , with whole plums intermixed , or piquant apple , delicately rose-flavored ; those cakes , heart-shaped or round , piled in a lofty pyramid ; those sweet little circlets , sweetly named kisses ; those dark , majestic masses , fit to be bridal-loaves at the wedding of an heiress , mountains in size , their summits deeply snow-covered with sugar !
Then the mighty treasures of sugar-plums , white and crimson and yellow , in large glass vases ; and candy of all varieties ; and those little cockles , or whatever they are called , much prized by children for their sweetness , and more for the mottoes which they enclose , by love-sick maids and bachelors !
O , my mouth waters , little Annie , and so doth yours ; but we will not be tempted , except to an imaginary feast ; so let us hasten onward , devouring the vision of a plum-cake .
Here are pleasures , as some people would say , of a more exalted kind , in the window of a bookseller .
Is Annie a literary lady ?
Yes ; she is deeply read in Peter Parley 's tomes , and has an increasing love for fairy-tales , though seldom met with nowadays , and she will subscribe , next year , to the Juvenile Miscellany .
But , truth to tell , she is apt to turn away from the printed page , and keep gazing at the pretty pictures , such as the gay-colored ones which make this shopwindow the continual loitering-place of children .
What would Annie think , if , in the book which I mean to send her , on New Year 's day , she should find her sweet little self , bound up in silk or morocco with gilt edges , there to remain till she become a woman grown with children of her own to read about their mother 's childhood !
That would be very queer .
Little Annie is weary of pictures , and pulls me onward by the hand , till suddenly we pause at the most wondrous shop in all the town .
O , my stars !
Is this a toy-shop , or is it fairy-land ?
For here are gilded chariots , in which the king and queen of the fairies might ride side by side , while their courtiers , on these small horses , should gallop in triumphal procession before and behind the royal pair .
Here , too , are dishes of china-ware , fit to be the dining set of those same princely personages , when they make a regal banquet in the stateliest ball of their palace , full five feet high , and behold their nobles feasting adown the long perspective of the table .
Betwixt the king and queen should sit my little Annie , the prettiest fairy of them all .
Here stands a turbaned Turk , threatening us with his sabre , like an ugly heathen as he is .
And next a Chinese mandarin , who nods his head at Annie and myself .
Here we may review a whole army of horse and foot , in red and blue uniforms , with drums , fifes , trumpets , and all kinds of noiseless music ; they have halted on the shelf of this window , after their weary march from Liliput .
But what cares Annie for soldiers ?
No conquering queen is she , neither a Semiramis nor a Catharine , her whole heart is set upon that doll , who gazes at us with such a fashionable stare .
This is the little girl 's true plaything .
Though made of wood , a doll is a visionary and ethereal personage , endowed by childish fancy with a peculiar life ; the mimic lady is a heroine of romance , an actor and a sufferer in a thousand shadowy scenes , the chief inhabitant of that wild world with which children ape the real one .
Little Annie does not understand what I am saying , but looks wishfully at the proud lady in the window .
We will invite her home with us as we return .
Meantime , good by , Dame Doll !
A toy yourself , you look forth from your window upon many ladies that are also toys , though they walk and speak , and upon a crowd in pursuit of toys , though they wear grave visages .
O , with your never-closing eyes , had you but an intellect to moralize on all that flits before them , what a wise doll would you be !
Come , little Annie , we shall find toys enough , go where we may .
Now we elbow our way among the throng again .
It is curious , in the most crowded part of a town , to meet with living creatures that had their birthplace in some far solitude , but have acquired a second nature in the wilderness of men .
Look up , Annie , at that canary-bird , hanging out of the window in his cage .
Poor little fellow !
His golden feathers are all tarnished in this smoky sunshine ; he would have glistened twice as brightly among the summer islands ; but still he has become a citizen in all his tastes and habits , and would not sing half so well without the uproar that drowns his music .
What a pity that he does not know how miserable he is !
There is a parrot , too , calling out , `` Pretty Poll !
Pretty Poll ! '' as we pass by .
Foolish bird , to be talking about her prettiness to strangers , especially as she is not a pretty Poll , though gaudily dressed in green and yellow .
If she had said , `` Pretty Annie , '' there would have been some sense in it .
See that gray squirrel at the door of the fruit-shop , whirling round and round so merrily within his wire wheel !
Being condemned to the treadmill , he makes it an amusement .
Admirable philosophy !
Here comes a big , rough dog , a countryman 's dog in search of his master ; smelling at everybody 's heels , and touching little Annie 's hand with his cold nose , but hurrying away , though she would fain have patted him .
Success to your search , Fidelity !
And there sits a great yellow cat upon a window-sill , a very corpulent and comfortable cat , gazing at this transitory world , with owl 's eyes , and making pithy comments , doubtless , or what appear such , to the silly beast .
O sage puss , make room for me beside you , and we will be a pair of philosophers !
Here we see something to remind us of the town crier , and his ding-dong bell !
Look ! look at that great cloth spread out in the air , pictured all over with wild beasts , as if they had met together to choose a king , according to their custom in the days of AEsop .
But they are choosing neither a king nor a president ; else we should hear a most horrible snarling !
They have come from the deep woods , and the wild mountains , and the desert sands , and the polar snows , only to do homage to my little Annie .
As we enter among them , the great elephant makes us a bow , in the best style of elephantine courtesy , bending lowly down his mountain bulk , with trunk abased , and leg thrust out behind .
Annie returns the salute , much to the gratification of the elephant , who is certainly the best-bred monster in the caravan .
The lion and the lioness are busy with two beef-bones .
The royal tiger , the beautiful , the untamable , keeps pacing his narrow cage with a haughty step , unmindful of the spectators , or recalling the fierce deeds of his former life , when he was wont to leap forth upon such inferior animals , from the jungles of Bengal .
Here we see the very same wolf , -- do not go near him , Annie ! -- the self-same wolf that devoured little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother .
In the next cage , a hyena from Egypt , who has doubtless howled around the pyramids , and a black bear from our own forests are fellow-prisoners , and most excellent friends .
Are there any two living creatures who have so few sympathies that they can not possibly be friends ?
Here sits a great white bear , whom common observers would call a very stupid beast , though I perceive him to be only absorbed in contemplation ; he is thinking of his voyages on an iceberg , and of his comfortable home in the vicinity of the north pole , and of the little cubs whom he left rolling in the eternal snows .
In fact , he is a bear of sentiment .
But , O , those unsentimental monkeys the ugly , grinning , aping , chattering , ill-natured , mischievous , and queer little brutes .
Annie does not love the monkeys .
Their ugliness shocks her pure , instinctive delicacy of taste , and makes her mind unquiet , because it bears a wild and dark resemblance to humanity .
But here is a little pony , just big enough for Annie to ride , and round and round he gallops in a circle , keeping time with his trampling hoofs to a band of music .
And here , -- with a laced coat and a cocked hat , and a riding whip in his hand , -- here comes a little gentleman , small enough to be king of the fairies , and ugly enough to be king of the gnomes , and takes a flying leap into the saddle .
Merrily , merrily plays the music , and merrily gallops the pony , and merrily rides the little old gentleman .
Come , Annie , into the street again ; perchance we may see monkeys on horseback there !
Mercy on us , what a noisy world we quiet people live in !
Did Annie ever read the Cries of London City ?
With what lusty lungs doth yonder man proclaim that his wheelbarrow is full of lobsters !
Here comes another mounted on a cart , and blowing a hoarse and dreadful blast from a tin horn , as much as to say , `` Fresh fish ! ''
And hark ! a voice on high , like that of a muezzin from the summit of a mosque , announcing that some chimney-sweeper has emerged from smoke and soot , and darksome caverns , into the upper air .
What cares the world for that ?
But , well-a-day , we hear a shrill voice of affliction , the scream of a little child , rising louder with every repetition of that smart , sharp , slapping sound , produced by an open hand on tender flesh .
Annie sympathizes , though without experience of such direful woe .
Lo ! the town crier again , with some new secret for the public ear .
Will he tell us of an auction , or of a lost pocketbook , or a show of beautiful wax figures , or of some monstrous beast more horrible than any in the caravan ?
I guess the latter .
See how he uplifts the bell in his right hand , and shakes it slowly at first , then with a hurried motion , till the clapper seems to strike both sides at once , and the sounds are scattered forth in quick succession , far and near .
Ding-dong !
Ding-dong !
Ding-dong !
Now he raises his clear , loud voice , above all the din of the town ; it drowns the buzzing talk of many tongues , and draws each man 's mind from his own business ; it rolls up and down the echoing street and ascends to the hushed chamber of the sick , and penetrates downward to the cellar kitchen , where the hot cook turns from the fire to listen .
Who , of all that address the public ear , whether in church , or court-house , or hall of state , has such an attentive audience as the town crier ?
What saith the people 's orator ?
`` Strayed from her home , a LITTLE GIRL , of five years old , in a blue silk frock and white pantalets , with brown curling hair and hazel eyes .
Whoever will bring her back to her afflicted mother -- '' Stop , stop , town crier !
The lost is found .
O , my pretty Annie , we forgot to tell your mother of our ramble , and she is in despair , and has sent the town crier to bellow up and down the streets , afrighting old and young , for the loss of a little girl who has not once let go my hand !
Well , let us hasten homeward ; and as we go , forget not to thank Heaven , my Annie , that , after wandering a little way into the world , you may return at the first summons , with an untainted and unwearied heart , and be a happy child again .
But I have gone too far astray for the town crier to call me back .
Sweet has been the charm of childhood on my spirit , throughout my ramble with little Annie !
Say not that it has been a waste of precious moments , an idle matter , a babble of childish talk , and a revery of childish imaginations , about topics unworthy of a grown man 's notice .
Has it been merely this ?
Not so ; not so .
They are not truly wise who would affirm it .
As the pure breath of children revives the life of aged men , so is our moral nature revived by their free and simple thoughts , their native feeling , their airy mirth , for little cause or none , their grief , soon roused and soon allayed .
Their influence on us is at least reciprocal with ours on them .
When our infancy is almost forgotten , and our boyhood long departed , though it seems but as yesterday ; when life settles darkly down upon us , and we doubt whether to call ourselves young any more , then it is good to steal away from the society of bearded men , and even of gentler woman , and spend an hour or two with children .
After drinking from those fountains of still fresh existence , we shall return into the crowd , as I do now , to struggle onward and do our part in life , perhaps as fervently as ever , but , for a time , with a kinder and purer heart , and a spirit more lightly wise .","A pleasing land of drowsy head it was , Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye ; And of gay castles in the clouds that pass , Forever flushing round a summer sky .
In the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern shore of the Hudson , at that broad expansion of the river denominated by the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee , and where they always prudently shortened sail and implored the protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed , there lies a small market town or rural port , which by some is called Greensburgh , but which is more generally and properly known by the name of Tarry Town .
This name was given , we are told , in former days , by the good housewives of the adjacent country , from the inveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village tavern on market days .
Be that as it may , I do not vouch for the fact , but merely advert to it , for the sake of being precise and authentic .
Not far from this village , perhaps about two miles , there is a little valley or rather lap of land among high hills , which is one of the quietest places in the whole world .
A small brook glides through it , with just murmur enough to lull one to repose ; and the occasional whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity .
I recollect that , when a stripling , my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley .
I had wandered into it at noontime , when all nature is peculiarly quiet , and was startled by the roar of my own gun , as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes .
If ever I should wish for a retreat whither I might steal from the world and its distractions , and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled life , I know of none more promising than this little valley .
From the listless repose of the place , and the peculiar character of its inhabitants , who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers , this sequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW , and its rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the neighboring country .
A drowsy , dreamy influence seems to hang over the land , and to pervade the very atmosphere .
Some say that the place was bewitched by a High German doctor , during the early days of the settlement ; others , that an old Indian chief , the prophet or wizard of his tribe , held his powwows there before the country was discovered by Master Hendrick Hudson .
Certain it is , the place still continues under the sway of some witching power , that holds a spell over the minds of the good people , causing them to walk in a continual reverie .
They are given to all kinds of marvellous beliefs , are subject to trances and visions , and frequently see strange sights , and hear music and voices in the air .
The whole neighborhood abounds with local tales , haunted spots , and twilight superstitions ; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across the valley than in any other part of the country , and the nightmare , with her whole ninefold , seems to make it the favorite scene of her gambols .
The dominant spirit , however , that haunts this enchanted region , and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air , is the apparition of a figure on horseback , without a head .
It is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper , whose head had been carried away by a cannon-ball , in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War , and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in the gloom of night , as if on the wings of the wind .
His haunts are not confined to the valley , but extend at times to the adjacent roads , and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance .
Indeed , certain of the most authentic historians of those parts , who have been careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this spectre , allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in the churchyard , the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head , and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes passes along the Hollow , like a midnight blast , is owing to his being belated , and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak .
Such is the general purport of this legendary superstition , which has furnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows ; and the spectre is known at all the country firesides , by the name of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow .
It is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have mentioned is not confined to the native inhabitants of the valley , but is unconsciously imbibed by every one who resides there for a time .
However wide awake they may have been before they entered that sleepy region , they are sure , in a little time , to inhale the witching influence of the air , and begin to grow imaginative , to dream dreams , and see apparitions .
I mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud , for it is in such little retired Dutch valleys , found here and there embosomed in the great State of New York , that population , manners , and customs remain fixed , while the great torrent of migration and improvement , which is making such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country , sweeps by them unobserved .
They are like those little nooks of still water , which border a rapid stream , where we may see the straw and bubble riding quietly at anchor , or slowly revolving in their mimic harbor , undisturbed by the rush of the passing current .
Though many years have elapsed since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow , yet I question whether I should not still find the same trees and the same families vegetating in its sheltered bosom .
In this by-place of nature there abode , in a remote period of American history , that is to say , some thirty years since , a worthy wight of the name of Ichabod Crane , who sojourned , or , as he expressed it , `` tarried , '' in Sleepy Hollow , for the purpose of instructing the children of the vicinity .
He was a native of Connecticut , a State which supplies the Union with pioneers for the mind as well as for the forest , and sends forth yearly its legions of frontier woodmen and country schoolmasters .
The cognomen of Crane was not inapplicable to his person .
He was tall , but exceedingly lank , with narrow shoulders , long arms and legs , hands that dangled a mile out of his sleeves , feet that might have served for shovels , and his whole frame most loosely hung together .
His head was small , and flat at top , with huge ears , large green glassy eyes , and a long snipe nose , so that it looked like a weather-cock perched upon his spindle neck to tell which way the wind blew .
To see him striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day , with his clothes bagging and fluttering about him , one might have mistaken him for the genius of famine descending upon the earth , or some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield .
His schoolhouse was a low building of one large room , rudely constructed of logs ; the windows partly glazed , and partly patched with leaves of old copybooks .
It was most ingeniously secured at vacant hours , by a withe twisted in the handle of the door , and stakes set against the window shutters ; so that though a thief might get in with perfect ease , he would find some embarrassment in getting out , -- an idea most probably borrowed by the architect , Yost Van Houten , from the mystery of an eelpot .
The schoolhouse stood in a rather lonely but pleasant situation , just at the foot of a woody hill , with a brook running close by , and a formidable birch-tree growing at one end of it .
From hence the low murmur of his pupils ' voices , conning over their lessons , might be heard in a drowsy summer 's day , like the hum of a beehive ; interrupted now and then by the authoritative voice of the master , in the tone of menace or command , or , peradventure , by the appalling sound of the birch , as he urged some tardy loiterer along the flowery path of knowledge .
Truth to say , he was a conscientious man , and ever bore in mind the golden maxim , `` Spare the rod and spoil the child . ''
Ichabod Crane 's scholars certainly were not spoiled .
I would not have it imagined , however , that he was one of those cruel potentates of the school who joy in the smart of their subjects ; on the contrary , he administered justice with discrimination rather than severity ; taking the burden off the backs of the weak , and laying it on those of the strong .
Your mere puny stripling , that winced at the least flourish of the rod , was passed by with indulgence ; but the claims of justice were satisfied by inflicting a double portion on some little tough wrong-headed , broad-skirted Dutch urchin , who sulked and swelled and grew dogged and sullen beneath the birch .
All this he called `` doing his duty by their parents ; '' and he never inflicted a chastisement without following it by the assurance , so consolatory to the smarting urchin , that `` he would remember it and thank him for it the longest day he had to live . ''
When school hours were over , he was even the companion and playmate of the larger boys ; and on holiday afternoons would convoy some of the smaller ones home , who happened to have pretty sisters , or good housewives for mothers , noted for the comforts of the cupboard .
Indeed , it behooved him to keep on good terms with his pupils .
The revenue arising from his school was small , and would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him with daily bread , for he was a huge feeder , and , though lank , had the dilating powers of an anaconda ; but to help out his maintenance , he was , according to country custom in those parts , boarded and lodged at the houses of the farmers whose children he instructed .
With these he lived successively a week at a time , thus going the rounds of the neighborhood , with all his worldly effects tied up in a cotton handkerchief .
That all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his rustic patrons , who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a grievous burden , and schoolmasters as mere drones , he had various ways of rendering himself both useful and agreeable .
He assisted the farmers occasionally in the lighter labors of their farms , helped to make hay , mended the fences , took the horses to water , drove the cows from pasture , and cut wood for the winter fire .
He laid aside , too , all the dominant dignity and absolute sway with which he lorded it in his little empire , the school , and became wonderfully gentle and ingratiating .
He found favor in the eyes of the mothers by petting the children , particularly the youngest ; and like the lion bold , which whilom so magnanimously the lamb did hold , he would sit with a child on one knee , and rock a cradle with his foot for whole hours together .
In addition to his other vocations , he was the singing-master of the neighborhood , and picked up many bright shillings by instructing the young folks in psalmody .
It was a matter of no little vanity to him on Sundays , to take his station in front of the church gallery , with a band of chosen singers ; where , in his own mind , he completely carried away the palm from the parson .
Certain it is , his voice resounded far above all the rest of the congregation ; and there are peculiar quavers still to be heard in that church , and which may even be heard half a mile off , quite to the opposite side of the millpond , on a still Sunday morning , which are said to be legitimately descended from the nose of Ichabod Crane .
Thus , by divers little makeshifts , in that ingenious way which is commonly denominated `` by hook and by crook , '' the worthy pedagogue got on tolerably enough , and was thought , by all who understood nothing of the labor of headwork , to have a wonderfully easy life of it .
The schoolmaster is generally a man of some importance in the female circle of a rural neighborhood ; being considered a kind of idle , gentlemanlike personage , of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to the rough country swains , and , indeed , inferior in learning only to the parson .
His appearance , therefore , is apt to occasion some little stir at the tea-table of a farmhouse , and the addition of a supernumerary dish of cakes or sweetmeats , or , peradventure , the parade of a silver teapot .
Our man of letters , therefore , was peculiarly happy in the smiles of all the country damsels .
How he would figure among them in the churchyard , between services on Sundays ; gathering grapes for them from the wild vines that overran the surrounding trees ; reciting for their amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones ; or sauntering , with a whole bevy of them , along the banks of the adjacent millpond ; while the more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back , envying his superior elegance and address .
From his half-itinerant life , also , he was a kind of travelling gazette , carrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house , so that his appearance was always greeted with satisfaction .
He was , moreover , esteemed by the women as a man of great erudition , for he had read several books quite through , and was a perfect master of Cotton Mather 's `` History of New England Witchcraft , '' in which , by the way , he most firmly and potently believed .
He was , in fact , an odd mixture of small shrewdness and simple credulity .
His appetite for the marvellous , and his powers of digesting it , were equally extraordinary ; and both had been increased by his residence in this spell-bound region .
No tale was too gross or monstrous for his capacious swallow .
It was often his delight , after his school was dismissed in the afternoon , to stretch himself on the rich bed of clover bordering the little brook that whimpered by his schoolhouse , and there con over old Mather 's direful tales , until the gathering dusk of evening made the printed page a mere mist before his eyes .
Then , as he wended his way by swamp and stream and awful woodland , to the farmhouse where he happened to be quartered , every sound of nature , at that witching hour , fluttered his excited imagination , -- the moan of the whip-poor-will from the hillside , the boding cry of the tree toad , that harbinger of storm , the dreary hooting of the screech owl , or the sudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened from their roost .
The fireflies , too , which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places , now and then startled him , as one of uncommon brightness would stream across his path ; and if , by chance , a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging his blundering flight against him , the poor varlet was ready to give up the ghost , with the idea that he was struck with a witch 's token .
His only resource on such occasions , either to drown thought or drive away evil spirits , was to sing psalm tunes and the good people of Sleepy Hollow , as they sat by their doors of an evening , were often filled with awe at hearing his nasal melody , `` in linked sweetness long drawn out , '' floating from the distant hill , or along the dusky road .
Another of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long winter evenings with the old Dutch wives , as they sat spinning by the fire , with a row of apples roasting and spluttering along the hearth , and listen to their marvellous tales of ghosts and goblins , and haunted fields , and haunted brooks , and haunted bridges , and haunted houses , and particularly of the headless horseman , or Galloping Hessian of the Hollow , as they sometimes called him .
He would delight them equally by his anecdotes of witchcraft , and of the direful omens and portentous sights and sounds in the air , which prevailed in the earlier times of Connecticut ; and would frighten them woefully with speculations upon comets and shooting stars ; and with the alarming fact that the world did absolutely turn round , and that they were half the time topsy-turvy !
But if there was a pleasure in all this , while snugly cuddling in the chimney corner of a chamber that was all of a ruddy glow from the crackling wood fire , and where , of course , no spectre dared to show its face , it was dearly purchased by the terrors of his subsequent walk homewards .
What fearful shapes and shadows beset his path , amidst the dim and ghastly glare of a snowy night !
With what wistful look did he eye every trembling ray of light streaming across the waste fields from some distant window !
How often was he appalled by some shrub covered with snow , which , like a sheeted spectre , beset his very path !
How often did he shrink with curdling awe at the sound of his own steps on the frosty crust beneath his feet ; and dread to look over his shoulder , lest he should behold some uncouth being tramping close behind him !
And how often was he thrown into complete dismay by some rushing blast , howling among the trees , in the idea that it was the Galloping Hessian on one of his nightly scourings !
All these , however , were mere terrors of the night , phantoms of the mind that walk in darkness ; and though he had seen many spectres in his time , and been more than once beset by Satan in divers shapes , in his lonely perambulations , yet daylight put an end to all these evils ; and he would have passed a pleasant life of it , in despite of the Devil and all his works , if his path had not been crossed by a being that causes more perplexity to mortal man than ghosts , goblins , and the whole race of witches put together , and that was -- a woman .
Among the musical disciples who assembled , one evening in each week , to receive his instructions in psalmody , was Katrina Van Tassel , the daughter and only child of a substantial Dutch farmer .
She was a blooming lass of fresh eighteen ; plump as a partridge ; ripe and melting and rosy-cheeked as one of her father 's peaches , and universally famed , not merely for her beauty , but her vast expectations .
She was withal a little of a coquette , as might be perceived even in her dress , which was a mixture of ancient and modern fashions , as most suited to set off her charms .
She wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold , which her great-great-grandmother had brought over from Saardam ; the tempting stomacher of the olden time , and withal a provokingly short petticoat , to display the prettiest foot and ankle in the country round .
Ichabod Crane had a soft and foolish heart towards the sex ; and it is not to be wondered at that so tempting a morsel soon found favor in his eyes , more especially after he had visited her in her paternal mansion .
Old Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving , contented , liberal-hearted farmer .
He seldom , it is true , sent either his eyes or his thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm ; but within those everything was snug , happy and well-conditioned .
He was satisfied with his wealth , but not proud of it ; and piqued himself upon the hearty abundance , rather than the style in which he lived .
His stronghold was situated on the banks of the Hudson , in one of those green , sheltered , fertile nooks in which the Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling .
A great elm tree spread its broad branches over it , at the foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water , in a little well formed of a barrel ; and then stole sparkling away through the grass , to a neighboring brook , that babbled along among alders and dwarf willows .
Hard by the farmhouse was a vast barn , that might have served for a church ; every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the treasures of the farm ; the flail was busily resounding within it from morning to night ; swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the eaves ; and rows of pigeons , some with one eye turned up , as if watching the weather , some with their heads under their wings or buried in their bosoms , and others swelling , and cooing , and bowing about their dames , were enjoying the sunshine on the roof .
Sleek unwieldy porkers were grunting in the repose and abundance of their pens , from whence sallied forth , now and then , troops of sucking pigs , as if to snuff the air .
A stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond , convoying whole fleets of ducks ; regiments of turkeys were gobbling through the farmyard , and Guinea fowls fretting about it , like ill-tempered housewives , with their peevish , discontented cry .
Before the barn door strutted the gallant cock , that pattern of a husband , a warrior and a fine gentleman , clapping his burnished wings and crowing in the pride and gladness of his heart , -- sometimes tearing up the earth with his feet , and then generously calling his ever-hungry family of wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered .
The pedagogue 's mouth watered as he looked upon this sumptuous promise of luxurious winter fare .
In his devouring mind 's eye , he pictured to himself every roasting-pig running about with a pudding in his belly , and an apple in his mouth ; the pigeons were snugly put to bed in a comfortable pie , and tucked in with a coverlet of crust ; the geese were swimming in their own gravy ; and the ducks pairing cosily in dishes , like snug married couples , with a decent competency of onion sauce .
In the porkers he saw carved out the future sleek side of bacon , and juicy relishing ham ; not a turkey but he beheld daintily trussed up , with its gizzard under its wing , and , peradventure , a necklace of savory sausages ; and even bright chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his back , in a side dish , with uplifted claws , as if craving that quarter which his chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living .
As the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this , and as he rolled his great green eyes over the fat meadow lands , the rich fields of wheat , of rye , of buckwheat , and Indian corn , and the orchards burdened with ruddy fruit , which surrounded the warm tenement of Van Tassel , his heart yearned after the damsel who was to inherit these domains , and his imagination expanded with the idea , how they might be readily turned into cash , and the money invested in immense tracts of wild land , and shingle palaces in the wilderness .
Nay , his busy fancy already realized his hopes , and presented to him the blooming Katrina , with a whole family of children , mounted on the top of a wagon loaded with household trumpery , with pots and kettles dangling beneath ; and he beheld himself bestriding a pacing mare , with a colt at her heels , setting out for Kentucky , Tennessee , -- or the Lord knows where !
When he entered the house , the conquest of his heart was complete .
It was one of those spacious farmhouses , with high-ridged but lowly sloping roofs , built in the style handed down from the first Dutch settlers ; the low projecting eaves forming a piazza along the front , capable of being closed up in bad weather .
Under this were hung flails , harness , various utensils of husbandry , and nets for fishing in the neighboring river .
Benches were built along the sides for summer use ; and a great spinning-wheel at one end , and a churn at the other , showed the various uses to which this important porch might be devoted .
From this piazza the wondering Ichabod entered the hall , which formed the centre of the mansion , and the place of usual residence .
Here rows of resplendent pewter , ranged on a long dresser , dazzled his eyes .
In one corner stood a huge bag of wool , ready to be spun ; in another , a quantity of linsey-woolsey just from the loom ; ears of Indian corn , and strings of dried apples and peaches , hung in gay festoons along the walls , mingled with the gaud of red peppers ; and a door left ajar gave him a peep into the best parlor , where the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables shone like mirrors ; andirons , with their accompanying shovel and tongs , glistened from their covert of asparagus tops ; mock-oranges and conch-shells decorated the mantelpiece ; strings of various-colored birds eggs were suspended above it ; a great ostrich egg was hung from the centre of the room , and a corner cupboard , knowingly left open , displayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended china .
From the moment Ichabod laid his eyes upon these regions of delight , the peace of his mind was at an end , and his only study was how to gain the affections of the peerless daughter of Van Tassel .
In this enterprise , however , he had more real difficulties than generally fell to the lot of a knight-errant of yore , who seldom had anything but giants , enchanters , fiery dragons , and such like easily conquered adversaries , to contend with and had to make his way merely through gates of iron and brass , and walls of adamant to the castle keep , where the lady of his heart was confined ; all which he achieved as easily as a man would carve his way to the centre of a Christmas pie ; and then the lady gave him her hand as a matter of course .
Ichabod , on the contrary , had to win his way to the heart of a country coquette , beset with a labyrinth of whims and caprices , which were forever presenting new difficulties and impediments ; and he had to encounter a host of fearful adversaries of real flesh and blood , the numerous rustic admirers , who beset every portal to her heart , keeping a watchful and angry eye upon each other , but ready to fly out in the common cause against any new competitor .
Among these , the most formidable was a burly , roaring , roystering blade , of the name of Abraham , or , according to the Dutch abbreviation , Brom Van Brunt , the hero of the country round , which rang with his feats of strength and hardihood .
He was broad-shouldered and double-jointed , with short curly black hair , and a bluff but not unpleasant countenance , having a mingled air of fun and arrogance .
From his Herculean frame and great powers of limb he had received the nickname of BROM BONES , by which he was universally known .
He was famed for great knowledge and skill in horsemanship , being as dexterous on horseback as a Tartar .
He was foremost at all races and cock fights ; and , with the ascendancy which bodily strength always acquires in rustic life , was the umpire in all disputes , setting his hat on one side , and giving his decisions with an air and tone that admitted of no gainsay or appeal .
He was always ready for either a fight or a frolic ; but had more mischief than ill-will in his composition ; and with all his overbearing roughness , there was a strong dash of waggish good humor at bottom .
He had three or four boon companions , who regarded him as their model , and at the head of whom he scoured the country , attending every scene of feud or merriment for miles round .
In cold weather he was distinguished by a fur cap , surmounted with a flaunting fox 's tail ; and when the folks at a country gathering descried this well-known crest at a distance , whisking about among a squad of hard riders , they always stood by for a squall .
Sometimes his crew would be heard dashing along past the farmhouses at midnight , with whoop and halloo , like a troop of Don Cossacks ; and the old dames , startled out of their sleep , would listen for a moment till the hurry-scurry had clattered by , and then exclaim , `` Ay , there goes Brom Bones and his gang ! ''
The neighbors looked upon him with a mixture of awe , admiration , and good-will ; and , when any madcap prank or rustic brawl occurred in the vicinity , always shook their heads , and warranted Brom Bones was at the bottom of it .
This rantipole hero had for some time singled out the blooming Katrina for the object of his uncouth gallantries , and though his amorous toyings were something like the gentle caresses and endearments of a bear , yet it was whispered that she did not altogether discourage his hopes .
Certain it is , his advances were signals for rival candidates to retire , who felt no inclination to cross a lion in his amours ; insomuch , that when his horse was seen tied to Van Tassel 's paling , on a Sunday night , a sure sign that his master was courting , or , as it is termed , `` sparking , '' within , all other suitors passed by in despair , and carried the war into other quarters .
Such was the formidable rival with whom Ichabod Crane had to contend , and , considering all things , a stouter man than he would have shrunk from the competition , and a wiser man would have despaired .
He had , however , a happy mixture of pliability and perseverance in his nature ; he was in form and spirit like a supple-jack -- yielding , but tough ; though he bent , he never broke ; and though he bowed beneath the slightest pressure , yet , the moment it was away -- jerk ! -- he was as erect , and carried his head as high as ever .
To have taken the field openly against his rival would have been madness ; for he was not a man to be thwarted in his amours , any more than that stormy lover , Achilles .
Ichabod , therefore , made his advances in a quiet and gently insinuating manner .
Under cover of his character of singing-master , he made frequent visits at the farmhouse ; not that he had anything to apprehend from the meddlesome interference of parents , which is so often a stumbling-block in the path of lovers .
Balt Van Tassel was an easy indulgent soul ; he loved his daughter better even than his pipe , and , like a reasonable man and an excellent father , let her have her way in everything .
His notable little wife , too , had enough to do to attend to her housekeeping and manage her poultry ; for , as she sagely observed , ducks and geese are foolish things , and must be looked after , but girls can take care of themselves .
Thus , while the busy dame bustled about the house , or plied her spinning-wheel at one end of the piazza , honest Balt would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other , watching the achievements of a little wooden warrior , who , armed with a sword in each hand , was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle of the barn .
In the mean time , Ichabod would carry on his suit with the daughter by the side of the spring under the great elm , or sauntering along in the twilight , that hour so favorable to the lover 's eloquence .
I profess not to know how women 's hearts are wooed and won .
To me they have always been matters of riddle and admiration .
Some seem to have but one vulnerable point , or door of access ; while others have a thousand avenues , and may be captured in a thousand different ways .
It is a great triumph of skill to gain the former , but a still greater proof of generalship to maintain possession of the latter , for man must battle for his fortress at every door and window .
He who wins a thousand common hearts is therefore entitled to some renown ; but he who keeps undisputed sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero .
Certain it is , this was not the case with the redoubtable Brom Bones ; and from the moment Ichabod Crane made his advances , the interests of the former evidently declined : his horse was no longer seen tied to the palings on Sunday nights , and a deadly feud gradually arose between him and the preceptor of Sleepy Hollow .
Brom , who had a degree of rough chivalry in his nature , would fain have carried matters to open warfare and have settled their pretensions to the lady , according to the mode of those most concise and simple reasoners , the knights-errant of yore , -- by single combat ; but Ichabod was too conscious of the superior might of his adversary to enter the lists against him ; he had overheard a boast of Bones , that he would `` double the schoolmaster up , and lay him on a shelf of his own schoolhouse ; '' and he was too wary to give him an opportunity .
There was something extremely provoking in this obstinately pacific system ; it left Brom no alternative but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery in his disposition , and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his rival .
Ichabod became the object of whimsical persecution to Bones and his gang of rough riders .
They harried his hitherto peaceful domains ; smoked out his singing school by stopping up the chimney ; broke into the schoolhouse at night , in spite of its formidable fastenings of withe and window stakes , and turned everything topsy-turvy , so that the poor schoolmaster began to think all the witches in the country held their meetings"
