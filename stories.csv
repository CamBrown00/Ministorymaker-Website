The Lonely Dinosaur,Always Listen,The Forest Princess,Puss in Boots,The Toad-Woman
"Many years ago dinosaurs were the largest creatures on earth. Some were very large and others small. They also came in many different colors. Behind the fiery mountains was a valley in which the dinosaurs spent the day. One sunny day the dinosaurs were playing a game of soccer. A new dinosaur that the other dinosaurs had not seen before came walking by. He stopped and watched and then he asked, "" Could I play too?"" All of the other dinosaurs looked at him. Together in one giant voice they said "" NO!"" The reason they had said no to him was because he looked different than the others. He had a long neck and he was green. None of them had ever heard of or seen a long necked, green dinosaur. The new dinosaur was very sad because everyone said no to him and they even called him 'Greeny'. His feelings were hurt. Slowly he sat down and sadly watched the others play.","Many moons ago there was a folk tale passed down from generation to generation. The story is about the Cho-Cho Man or the Boogie Man. It all began with a young boy named Dakota. Dakota's mother had asked him to gather some firewood for the evening fire. The nights were getting cooler. Instead of doing the chore right away, Dakota figured he had enough sunlight left to do two things. He would gather the firewood after he played with his friends Morgan, Joey, and Bo. Not long after, his mother began to wonder why Dakota never came with any firewood. Night had fallen fast and it was too hard to see the firewood. Dakota realized what had happened. He told his friends about his predicament and they said that they would help their friend. Soon after, the young boys were gathering wood in the dark. Dakota's mother was worried that something had happened. She went looking for Dakota. Not long after, she heard the boys. She had mixed feelings. She was happy to see Dakota but she was also mad that he hadn't listened to his mother. She wanted to teach Dakota and his friends a lesson so she sneaked into the bush very quietly. Then she picked up a twig and threw it. The twig hit the ground making noise. It caught the boys' attention. She threw another broken twig in the opposite direction. The boys jumped. The mother had a hard time holding back her laughter and a muffled moan sounded through her fingers. The boys were definitely scared. But Dakota was the brave one. He ventured forward. The mother moaned again; she threw another twig. The boys were transfixed. Once more the mother moaned in a low and deep voice, ""Listen to your mother."" The boys dropped everything and ran. The mother could not hold back her laughter and the boys, hearing this, scurried home even faster. After the mother had picked up some firewood, she proceeded home, where she found Dakota in tears. Dakota exclaimed, ""Mother, Mother I'm sorry I didn't listen to you."" His mother held him with love and she knew that he was truly sorry. From then on when Dakota felt like not listening, the mother would mention, ""The boogie-man will scare you if you misbehave.""","A long time ago, in a big beautiful forest there lived many animals. The animals in the forest were happy and they lived a wonderful life. One reason that the animals were happy was because in the forest there also lived a little princess. The little princess had long curly, blonde hair. Do you know what her name was? It might surprise you but her name was Marina! Yes, Marina, a beautiful name for a beautiful little princess. Every morning she would go to the park near the river to play with her friends. Mrs. Rabbit, Mr. Skunk and the very young deer were her best friends. One day they were playing together. They were having so much fun that they lost track of the time. The sun went down and it became dark. The little animals were afraid to go home alone. Princess Marina had an idea. She said, ""Why don't you all come to my Grandpa's home with me. Grandpa doesn't mind it when I bring my friends to his place."" When Marina and her friends arrived at her grandpa's house her invited them in. He gave them all the treats that they could eat. After they ate they all played games. After a time Grandpa in a deep loud voice said, ""It's time for bed now."" Grandpa gathered all the friends around and told them a bedtime story. Before long everyone was fast asleep. In the morning it was safe for the animals to go home. Everyday Marina and her friends still play but now they make sure that they go home before it gets dark.","There was once a Miller, who, at his death, had nothing to leave to his three sons except his mill, his ass, and his cat. The eldest son took the mill, the second took the ass—and as for the youngest, all that remained for him was the cat.

The youngest son grumbled at this. ""My brothers,"" said he, ""will be able to earn an honest living; but when I have eaten my cat and sold his skin I shall die of hunger.""

The Cat, who was sitting beside him, overheard this.

""Nay, Master,"" he said, ""don't take such a gloomy view of things. If you will get me a pair of boots made so that I can walk through the brambles without hurting my feet, and give me a bag, you shall soon see what I am worth.""

The Cat's master was so surprised to hear his Cat talking, that he at once got him what he wanted. The Cat drew on the boots and slung the bag round his neck and set off for a rabbit warren. When he got there he filled his bag with bran and lettuces, and stretching himself out beside it as if dead, waited until some young rabbit should be tempted into the bag. This happened very soon. A fat, thoughtless rabbit went in headlong, and the Cat at once jumped up, pulled the strings and killed him.

Puss was very proud of his success, and, going to the King's palace, he asked to speak to the King. When he was shown into the King's presence he bowed respectfully, and, laying the rabbit down before the throne, he said—
""Sire, here is a rabbit, which my master, the Marquis of Carabas, desires me to present to your Majesty.""

""Tell your master,"" said the King, ""that I accept his present, and am very much obliged to him.""

A few days later, the Cat went and hid himself in a cornfield and laid his bag open as before. This time two splendid partridges were lured into the trap, and these also he took to the Palace and presented to the King from the Marquis of Carabas. The King was very pleased with this gift, and ordered the messenger of the Marquis of Carabas to be handsomely rewarded.

For two or three months the Cat went on in this way, carrying game every day to the Palace, and saying it was sent by the Marquis of Carabas.

At last the Cat happened to hear that the King was going to take a drive on the banks of the river, with his daughter, the most beautiful Princess in the world. He at once went to his master.

""Master,"" said he, ""if you follow my advice, your fortune will be made. Go and bathe in the river at a place I shall show you, and I will do the rest.""

""Very well,"" said the Miller's son, and he did as the Cat told him. When he was in the water, the Cat took away his clothes and hid them, and then ran to the road, just as the King's coach went by, calling out as loudly as he could—
""Help, help! The Marquis of Carabas will be drowned.""

The King looked out of the carriage window, and when he saw the Cat who had brought him so many fine rabbits and partridges, he ordered his bodyguards to fly at once to the rescue of the Marquis of Carabas.

Then the Cat came up to the carriage and told the King that while his master was bathing some robbers had stolen all his clothes. The King immediately ordered one of his own magnificent suits of clothes to be taken to the Marquis; so when the Miller's son appeared before the monarch and his daughter, he looked so handsome, and was so splendidly attired, that the Princess fell in love with him on the spot.



The King was so struck with his appearance that he insisted upon his getting into the carriage to take a drive with them.
The Cat, delighted with the way his plans were turning out, ran on before. He reached a meadow where some peasants were making hay.

""Good people,"" said he, ""if you do not tell the King, when he comes this way, that the meadow you are mowing belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall all be chopped up into little pieces.""

When the King came by, he stopped to ask the haymakers to whom the meadow belonged.
""To the Marquis of Carabas, if it please Your Majesty,"" answered they, trembling, for the Cat's threat had frightened them terribly.

The Cat, who continued to run before the carriage, now came to some reapers.
""Good people,"" said he, ""if you do not tell the King that all this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall all be chopped up into little pieces.""

The King again stopped to ask to whom the land belonged, and the reapers, obedient to the Cat's command, answered—
""To the Marquis of Carabas, please Your Majesty.""

And all the way the Cat kept running on before the carriage, repeating the same instructions to all the laborers he came to; so that the King became very astonished at the vast possessions of the Marquis of Carabas.

At last the Cat arrived at a great castle, where an Ogre lived who was very rich, for all the lands through which the King had been riding were part of his estate. The Cat knocked at the castle door, and asked to see the Ogre.

The Ogre received him very civilly, and asked him what he wanted.

""If you please, sir,"" said the Cat, ""I have heard that you have the power of changing yourself into any sort of animal you please—and I came to see if it could possibly be true.""

""So I have,"" replied the Ogre, and in a moment he turned himself into a lion. This gave the Cat a great fright, and he scrambled up the curtains to the ceiling.

""Indeed, sir,"" he said, ""I am now quite convinced of your power to turn yourself into such a huge animal as a lion; but I do not suppose you can change yourself into a small one—such as a mouse, for instance?""

""Indeed, I can,"" cried the Ogre, indignantly; and in a moment the lion had vanished, while a little brown mouse frisked about the floor.

In less than half a second the Cat sprang down from the curtains and, pouncing upon the mouse, ate him all up before the Ogre had time to return to any other shape.

And when the King arrived at the castle gates, there stood the Cat upon the doorstep, bowing and saying—
""Welcome to the castle of the Marquis of Carabas!""

The Marquis helped the King and the Princess to alight, and the Cat led them into a great hall, where a feast had been spread for the Ogre.

The King was so delighted with the good looks, the charming manners, and the great wealth of the Marquis of Carabas, that he said the Marquis must marry his daughter.

The Marquis, of course, replied that he should be only too happy; and the very next day he and the Princess were married.
As for the Cat, he was given the title of Puss-in-Boots, and ever after only caught mice for his own amusement.
","Great good luck once happened to a young woman who was living all alone in the woods with nobody near her but her little dog; for, to her surprise, she found fresh meat every morning at her door. She was very curious to know who it was that supplied her, and watching one morning, just as the sun had risen, she saw a handsome young man gliding away into the forest. Having seen her, he became her husband, and she had a son by him.
 
One day, not long after this, he did not return at evening, as usual, from hunting. She waited till late at night, but he came no more.
 
The next day, she swung her child to sleep in its cradle, and then said to her dog, ""Take care of your brother while I am gone, and when he cries, halloo for me.""
 
The cradle was made of the finest wampum, and all its bandages and ornaments were of the same precious stuff.
 
After a short time, the woman heard the cry of the dog, and running home as fast as she could, she found her child gone, and the dog too. On looking around, she saw scattered upon the ground pieces of the wampum of her child's cradle, and she knew that the dog had been faithful, and had striven his best to save her child from being carried off, as he had been, by an old woman, from a distant country, called Mukakee Mindemoea, or the Toad-Woman.
 
The mother hurried off at full speed in pursuit, and as she flew along, she came, from time to time, to lodges inhabited by old women, who told her at what time the child-thief had passed; they also gave her shoes that she might follow on. There was a number of these old women who seemed as if they were prophetesses, and knew what was to come long beforehand. Each of them would say to her that when she had arrived at the next lodge, she must set the toes of the moccasins they had given her pointing homeward, and that they would return of themselves. The young woman was very careful to send back in this manner all the shoes she borrowed.
 
She thus followed in the pursuit, from valley to valley, and stream to stream, for many months and years; when she came at length to the lodge of the last of the friendly old grandmothers, as they were called, who gave her the last instructions how to proceed. She told her that she was near the place where her son was to be found; and she directed her to build a lodge of cedar-boughs, hard by the old Toad-Woman's lodge, and to make a little bark dish, and to fill it with the juice of the wild grape.
 
""Then,"" she said, ""your first child (meaning the dog) will come and find you out.""
 
These directions the young woman followed just as they had been given to her, and in a short time she heard her son, now grown up, going out to hunt, with his dog, calling out to him, ""Peewaubik—Spirit-Iron—Twee! Twee!""
 
The dog soon came into the lodge, and she set before him the dish of grape-juice.
 
""See, my child,"" she said, addressing him, ""the pretty drink your mother gives you.""
 
Spirit-Iron took a long draught, and immediately left the lodge with his eyes wide open; for it was the drink which teaches one to see the truth of things as they are. He rose up when he got into the open air, stood upon his hind legs, and looked about. ""I see how it is,"" he said; and marching off, erect like a man, he sought out his young master.
 
Approaching him in great confidence, he bent down and whispered in his ear (having first looked cautiously around to see that no one was listening), ""This old woman here in the lodge is no mother of yours. I have found your real mother, and she is worth looking at. When we come back from our day's sport, I'll prove it to you.""
 
They went out into the woods, and at the close of the afternoon they brought back a great spoil of meat of all kinds. The young man, as soon as he had laid aside his weapons, said to the old Toad-Woman, ""Send some of the best of this meat to the stranger who has arrived lately.""
 
The Toad-Woman answered, ""No! Why should I send to her, the poor widow!""
 
The young man would not be refused; and at last the old Toad-Woman consented to take something and throw it down at the door. She called out, ""My son gives you this."" But, being bewitched by Mukakee Mindemoea, it was so bitter and distasteful, that the young woman immediately cast it out of the lodge after her.
 
In the evening the young man paid the stranger a visit at her lodge of cedar-boughs. She then told him that she was his real mother, and that he had been stolen away from her by the old Toad-Woman, who was a child-thief and a witch. As the young man appeared to doubt, she added, ""Feign yourself sick when you go home to her lodge; and when the Toad-Woman asks what ails you, say that you wish to see your cradle; for your cradle was of wampum, and your faithful brother the dog, in striving to save you, tore off these pieces which I show you.""
 
They were real wampum, white and blue, shining and beautiful; and the young man, placing them in his bosom, set off; but as he did not seem quite steady in his belief of the strange woman's story, the dog Spirit-Iron, taking his arm, kept close by his side, and gave him many words of encouragement as they went along. They entered the lodge together; and the old Toad-Woman saw, from something in the dog's eye, that trouble was coming.
 
""Mother,"" said the young man, placing his hand to his head, and leaning heavily upon Spirit-Iron, as if a sudden faintness had come upon him, ""why am I so different in looks from the rest of your children?""
 
""Oh,"" she answered, ""it was a very bright, clear blue sky when you were born; that is the reason.""
 
He seemed to be so very ill that the Toad-Woman at length asked what she could do for him. He said nothing could do him good but the sight of his cradle. She ran immediately and brought a cedar cradle; but he said:
 
""That is not my cradle.""
 
She went and got another of her own children's cradles, of which there were four; but he turned his head, and said:
 
""That is not mine; I am as sick as ever.""
 
When she had shown the four, and they had been all rejected, she at last produced the real cradle. The young man saw that it was of the same stuff as the wampum which he had in his bosom. He could even see the marks of the teeth of Spirit-Iron left upon the edges, where he had taken hold, striving to hold it back. He had no doubt, now, which was his mother.
 
To get free of the old Toad-Woman, it was necessary that the young man should kill a fat bear; and, being directed by Spirit-Iron, who was very wise in such a matter, he secured the fattest in all that country; and having stripped a tall pine of all its bark and branches, he perched the carcass in the top, with its head to the east and its tail due west. Returning to the lodge, he informed the old Toad-Woman that the fat bear was ready for her, but that she would have to go very far, even to the end of the earth, to get it. She answered:
 
""It is not so far but that I can get it;"" for of all things in the world, a fat bear was the delight of the old Toad-Woman.
 
She at once set forth; and she was no sooner out of sight than the young man and his dog, Spirit-Iron, blowing a strong breath in the face of the Toad-Woman's four children (who were all bad spirits, or bear-fiends), they put out their life. They then set them up by the side of the door, having first thrust a piece of the white fat in each of their mouths.
 
The Toad-Woman spent a long time in finding the bear which she had been sent after, and she made at least five and twenty attempts before she was able to climb to the carcass. She slipped down three times where she went up once. When she returned with the great bear on her back, as she drew near her lodge she was astonished to see the four children standing up by the door-posts with the fat in their mouths. She was angry with them, and called out:
 
""Why do you thus insult the pomatum of your brother?""
 
She was still more angry when they made no answer to her complaint; but when she found that they were stark dead, and placed in this way to mock her, her fury was very great indeed. She ran after the tracks of the young man and his mother as fast as she could; so fast, indeed, that she was on the very point of overtaking them, when the dog, Spirit-Iron, coming close up to his master, whispered to him—""Snakeberry!""
 
""Let the snakeberry spring up to detain her!"" cried out the young man; and immediately the berries spread like scarlet all over the path, for a long distance; and the old Toad-Woman, who was almost as fond of these berries as she was of fat bears, could not avoid stooping down to pick and eat.
 
The old Toad-Woman was very anxious to get forward, but the snakeberry-vines kept spreading out on every side; and they still grow and grow, and spread and spread; and to this day the wicked old Toad-Woman is busy picking the berries, and she will never be able to get beyond to the other side, to disturb the happiness of the young hunter and his mother, who still live, with their faithful dog, in the shadow of the beautiful wood-side where they were born."
