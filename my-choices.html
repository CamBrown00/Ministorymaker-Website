        <h1>My Choices</h1>
        <p>
            Mini Story Maker provides an online 
           experience for reading children's stories and creating your own story 
           through a randomly-generated and Mad Libs story functionality. 
           There are 30,488,290,624 (3,124 sentences ^ 3) possible random stories 
           to make at every click of the make-a-story button. We based the premise of the site on Mad Libs, with an added 
            an element of random generation, and incorporated children's 
            literature to focus more on the younger demographic. Mini Story Maker provides both utility and entertainment for story-loving users. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We styled the page with all of these facts in mind, and especially 
            paid attention to making the site appealing to our target 
            demographic. “Simple and comfortable” was the guiding phrase we used 
            in styling each of the pages. Some aspects of the design that 
            exemplify this are the minimal use of thin borders, frequent use of 
            rounded edges, warm and muted colors, etc. We also utilized 
            transitions as often as possible to keep everything looking smooth. 
            Buttons and clickable links are hard to miss as well, and we tried 
            to make the story maker as intuitive as possible with a simple 
            control scheme and brief instructions. We also placed instructions 
            for the story maker on multiple pages. This was to account for the 
            possibility of the user being unable to decide where to look for 
            them, or if they overlooked them on one page. 
            Following is a series of summaries that detail the roles and 
            features implemented by each member of our group.

        <h2>The Read a Story Page</h2>
        <p>
            I worked on implementing the functionality of the read-a-story page,
            created the framework for the pages, wrote some of the content for 
            the about page, created the feedback page, and styled some of the 
            pages. Implementing the flexslider turned out to be more time 
            consuming than I had originally thought. Because the slider wasn’t 
            built to display content that varies greatly in length, I had to 
            write some functions to accommodate for this shortcoming. The main 
            issue I encountered was allowing the content in the flexslider to 
            minimize and maximize, but only minimize partially. I struggled more 
            with the design than the code itself, as it wasn’t a very 
            technically complex problem. I had to implement a minimize/maximize 
            button that could meet a number of criteria. It had to be functional 
            on all platforms, unobtrusive, and always available to the user. 
        </p>
        <h2>Styling Choices</h2>
        <p>
            Once I designed a button that fulfilled these criteria and organized 
            the HTML for the rest of the Read a Story page, I moved on to 
            styling the page and laying the groundwork for how the remainder of 
            the pages were to be styled. I tried my best to abide by the guiding 
            design conventions laid out and stay faithful to the storyboard and 
            the images we used for reference. Even though my original role was 
            lead developer, I feel that my group members went above and beyond 
            in the programming aspects of the project. They handled the feature 
            page, Make a Story, and set up the domain for the site.

        <h2>Project Setup & Storyboard</h2>
        <p>
            I was the project manager for the group and was in charge of all 
            the documentation and setting up the domain for the site. I also 
            wrote the content for the most of the pages, and helped set up the 
            design foundations for the site. Early in the project time line the 
            group was focused on creating the rough framework for the site. 
            During this process I created the storyboard and set up the CSS to 
            prepare for the first usability tests. The storyboard was used 
            throughout the development process to keep the content organized 
            and the style guidelines that we referenced throughout were based 
            on the general look of the storyboard along with the various 
            reference images gathered.
        </p>
        <h2>Site Navigation</h2>
        <p>
            I also was in charge of designing the navigation for the site, and 
            styled it for both mobile and desktop. Originally I planned on 
            implementing a responsive navigation with the hamburger menu, but 
            our nav implementation in the HTML and the styling already in 
            place made this task fairly inconvenient. I designed the nav to 
            be sticky on desktop without being distracting, and opted to use a 
            stacked nav on mobile. I decided to go with a stacked mobile nav 
            because the overall short page length and page quantity allowed for 
            it to be implemented without the regular hang ups that it typically 
            comes with on mobile. The added transition properties also 
            complimented this design choice as well.

        <p>The main functionalities of Mini Story Maker allows users to make and 
           read children’s stories on the web.</p>
        <h2>Random “Mad Libs” story generator</h2>
        <p>
            The unique functionality of this site is its ability to randomly produce 
            three-sentence stories from a database of over 3,000 sentence 
            possibilities taken from 10 freely accessed children’s stories. Once 
            a random three-sentence story is generated, the user has the ability 
            to enter a sentence or ending of of their own. The user can then 
            rate, save and send their story to an email address they provide. 
            User-generated stories are saved to a randomStories.csv file 
            (without their email address, for privacy considerations). 
        </p>
        <h2>PHP functions in read-sentences-data.php</h2>
        <p>
            In order to randomly select and read three lines from our csv file 
            of 3,124 sentences, and store the lines in variables, I created 
            several steps in PHP that were implemented in 
            read-sentences-data.php.
        </p>
        <h2>Story input and name validation</h2>
        <p>
            To allow the user to enter several punctuation marks typical to a 
            sentence, I created a regular expression validation function to 
            allow more than alphanumeric characters. We also added a validation 
            function for names to allow names with special characters, hyphens, 
            and periods.
        </p>
        <h2>Star-rating radio buttons</h2>
        <p>
            The Make a Story form features a star rating functionality 
            implemented with css.
        </p>
        <h2>Python scripts for text parsing</h2>
        <p>
            I created a python script to parse through a file of 98 children’s 
            stories made public from the Facebook bAbl project and separate each 
            story into a file with a single sentence on each line. We selected 5 
            stories from this collection. I created a second python script to 
            parse through any story and separate the sentences by new lines. 
            This help to create a csv file of 10 stories, with a different 
            sentence per line, that included title/author/publication date 
            information. We don’t use python on our live site, but the scripts 
            are included for reference. 
        </p>
        <h2>Design choices</h2>
        <p>
            The site colors and overall style were inspired by a California 
            poppies image, which represented the cheerful, primary color 
            palette we wanted to use to express the mood of our site, and to 
            appeal to a young to older audience. The Make a Story page is 
            designed to mimic a real paper story.
